With age comes wisdom. And you should be wise enough to know that you’ll always be [13 MONTHS] older than me!

Don’t think of it as getting older. Think of it as a day in which you can eat as much cake you like, and no one will judge.

Getting old is tough, but it sure beats the alternative!

Happy birthday to someone who is totally hot. Maybe you should blow out all those candles!

Happy Birthday, O-L-D friend!

Happy 29th Birthday! Again

You’re halfway to death! Congrats!

You deserve the very best of everything. I guess that’s why you have me.

You look younger every year. But then again my eyes are getting old.

Hope your birthday is more fun than time you spent in prison. 

Have fun, but don’t call me for bail money.
