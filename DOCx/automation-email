With a year long project coming to an end (1jan10) I would like to get this out there before the inevitable outcome.  30days (including W/Es and I have been told I am to be working 10 hour days (without compensation) and the project is now mine.

You already are abusing Kenny and I will not fall into that trap.  I'm older and wiser.  You have set Kenny up top fail and now you are trying to do the same to me.
