Given a RAID array (of any size).  What should you consider before creating a filesystem?

What are the RAID levels
        RAID 0 (block-level striping without parity or mirroring)

        RAID 6 (block-level striping with double distributed parity)
	RAID 0+1: striped sets in a mirrored set
    	RAID 1+0 is that RAID 0+1 creates a second striped set to mirror a primary striped set.
    	RAID 1+0: (a.k.a. RAID 10) mirrored sets in a striped set
	RAID 5+1: mirrored striped set with distributed parity

What happens when you type a URL into your browser?

In an extremely rough and simplified sketch, assuming the simplest possible HTTP request, 
no proxies and IPv4 (this would work similarly for IPv6-only client, but I have yet to see 
such workstation):

    1. browser checks cache; if requested object is in cache and is fresh, skip to #9
    2. browser asks OS for server's IP address
    3. OS makes a DNS lookup and replies the IP address to the browser
    4. browser opens a TCP connection to server (this step is much more complex with HTTPS)
    5. browser sends the HTTP request through TCP connection
    6. browser receives HTTP response and may close the TCP connection, or reuse it for 
       another request
    7. browser checks if the response is a redirect (3xx result status codes), authorization
       request (401), error (4xx and 5xx), etc.; these are handled differently from normal 
       responses (2xx)
    8. if cacheable, response is stored in cache
    9. browser decodes response (e.g. if it's gzipped)
    10. browser determines what to do with response (e.g. is it a HTML page, is it an 
        image, is it a sound clip?)
    11. browser renders response, or offers a download dialog for unrecognized types

Again, discussion of each of these points have filled countless pages; take this as a 
starting point. Also, there are many other things happening in parallel to this 
(processing typed-in address, adding page to browser history, displaying progress to user, 
notifying plugins and extensions, rendering the page while it's downloading, pipelining, 
connection tracking for keep-alive, etc.).
