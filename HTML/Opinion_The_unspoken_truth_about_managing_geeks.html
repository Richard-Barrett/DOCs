*September 8, 2009* (Computerworld) <http://www.computerworld.com> I can
sum up every article, book and column written by notable management
experts about managing IT in two sentences: "Geeks are smart and
creative, but they are also egocentric, antisocial, managerially and
business-challenged, victim-prone, bullheaded and credit-whoring. To
overcome these intractable behavioral deficits you must do X, Y and Z."

X, Y and Z are variable and usually contradictory between one expert and
the next, but the patronizing stereotypes remain constant. I'm not
entirely sure that is helpful. So, using the familiar brush, allow me to
paint a different picture of those IT pros buried somewhere in your
organization.

Computerworld columnist Jeff Ello
Jeff Ello

My career has been stippled with a good bit of disaster recovery
consulting, which has led me to deal with dozens of organizations on
their worst day, when opinions were pretty raw. I've heard all of the
above-mentioned stereotypes and far worse, as well as good bit of rage.
The worse shape an organization is in, the more you hear the stereotypes
thrown around. But my personal experiences working within IT groups have
always been quite good, working with IT pros for whom the negative
stereotypes just don't seem to apply. I tended to chalk up IT group
failures to some bad luck in hiring and the delicate balance of those
geek stereotypes.

Recently, though, I have come to realize that perfectly healthy groups
with solid, well-adjusted IT pros can and will devolve, slowly and
quietly, into the behaviors that give rise to the stereotypes, given the
right set of conditions. It turns out that it is the conditions that are
stereotypical, and the IT pros tend to react to those conditions in
logical ways. To say it a different way, organizations actively elicit
these stereotypical negative behaviors.

Understanding why IT pros appear to act the way they do makes working
with, among and as one of them the easiest job in the world.


      It's all about respect

Few people notice this, but for IT groups respect is the currency of the
realm. IT pros do not squander this currency. Those whom they do not
believe are worthy of their respect might instead be treated to
professional courtesy, a friendly demeanor or the acceptance of
authority. Gaining respect is not a matter of being the boss and has
nothing to do with being likeable or sociable; whether you talk, eat or
smell right; or any measure that isn't directly related to the work. The
amount of respect an IT pro pays someone is a measure of how tolerable
that person is when it comes to getting things done, including the
elegance and practicality of his solutions and suggestions. IT pros
always and without fail, quietly self-organize around those who make the
work easier, while shunning those who make the work harder, independent
of the organizational chart.

This self-ordering behavior occurs naturally in the IT world because it
is populated by people skilled in creative analysis and ordered
reasoning. Doctors are a close parallel. The stakes may be higher in
medicine, but the work in both fields requires a technical expertise
that can't be faked and a proficiency that can only be measured by
qualified peers. I think every good IT pro on the planet idolizes Dr.
House (minus the addictions).

While everyone would like to work for a nice person who is always right,
IT pros will prefer a jerk who is always right over a nice person who is
always wrong. Wrong creates unnecessary work, impossible situations and
major failures. Wrong is evil, and it must be defeated. Capacity for
technical reasoning trumps all other professional factors, period.

Foundational (bottom-up) respect is not only the largest single
determining factor in the success of an IT team, but the most ignored. I
believe you can predict success or failure of an IT group simply by
assessing the amount of mutual respect within it.


      The elements of the stereotypes

*Ego -- *Similar to what good doctors do, IT pros figure out that the
proper projection of ego engenders trust and reduces apprehension.
Because IT pros' education does not emphasize how to deal with people,
there are always rough edges. Ego, as it plays out in IT, is an
essential confidence combined with a not-so-subtle cynicism. It's not
about being right for the sake of being right but being right for the
sake of saving a lot of time, effort, money and credibility. IT is a
team sport, so being right or wrong impacts other members of the group
in non-trivial ways. Unlike in many industries, in IT, colleagues can
significantly influence the careers of the entire team. Correctness
yields respect, respect builds good teams, and good teams build trust
and maintain credibility through a healthy projection of ego. Strong IT
groups view correctness as a virtue, and certitude as a delivery method.
Meek IT groups, beaten down by inconsistent policies and a lack of
structural support, are simply ineffective at driving change and
creating efficiencies, getting mowed over by the clients, the management
or both at every turn.

*The victim mentality -- *IT pros are sensitive to logic -- that's what
you pay them for. When things don't add up, they are prone to express
their opinions on the matter, and the level of response will be
proportional to the absurdity of the event. The more things that occur
that make no sense, the more cynical IT pros will become. Standard
organizational politics often run afoul of this, so IT pros can come to
be seen as whiny or as having a victim mentality. Presuming this is a
trait that must be disciplined out of them is a huge management mistake.
IT pros complain primarily about logic, and primarily to people they
respect. If you are dismissive of complaints, fail to recognize an
illogical event or behave in deceptive ways, IT pros will likely stop
complaining to you. You might mistake this as a behavioral improvement,
when it's actually a show of disrespect. It means you are no longer
worth talking to, which leads to insubordination.

*Insubordination -- *This is a tricky one. Good IT pros are not
anti-bureaucracy, as many observers think. They are anti-stupidity. The
difference is both subjective and subtle. Good IT pros, whether they are
expected to or not, have to operate and make decisions with little
supervision. So when the rules are loose and logical and supervision is
results-oriented, supportive and helpful to the process, IT pros are
loyal, open, engaged and downright sociable. Arbitrary or
micro-management, illogical decisions, inconsistent policies, the
creation of unnecessary work and exclusionary practices will elicit a
quiet, subversive, almost vicious attitude from otherwise excellent IT
staff. Interestingly, IT groups don't fall apart in this mode. From the
outside, nothing looks to be wrong and the work still gets done. But
internally, the IT group, or portions of it, may cut themselves off
almost entirely from the intended management structure. They may work on
big projects or steer the group entirely from the shadows while
diverting the attention of supervisors to lesser topics. They believe
they are protecting the organization, as well as their own credibility
-- and they are often correct.

*Credit whoring -- *IT pros would prefer to make a good decision than to
get credit for it. What will make them seek credit is the danger that a
member of the group or management who is dangerous to the process might
receive the credit for the work instead. That is insulting. If you've
got a lot of credit whores in your IT group, there are bigger problems
causing it.

*Antisocial behavior -- *It's fair to say that there is a large
contingent of IT pros who are socially unskilled. However, this doesn't
mean those IT pros are antisocial. On the whole, they have plenty to
say. If you want to get your IT pros more involved, you should deal with
the problems laid out above and then train your other staff how to deal
with IT. Users need to be reminded a few things, including:

    * IT wants to help me.
    * I should keep an open mind.
    * IT is not my personal tech adviser, nor is my work computer my
      personal computer.
    * IT people have lives and other interests.

Like anyone else, IT people tend to socialize with people who respect
them. They'll stop going to the company picnic if it becomes an occasion
for everyone to list all the computer problems they never bothered to
mention before.


      How we elicit the stereotypes

What executives often fail to recognize is that every decision made that
impacts IT is a technical decision. Not just some of the decisions, and
not just the details of the decision, but every decision, bar none.

With IT, you cannot separate the technical aspects from the business
aspects. They are one and the same, each constrained by the other and
both constrained by creativity. Creativity is the most valuable asset of
an IT group, and failing to promote it can cost an organization
literally millions of dollars.

Most IT pros support an organization that is not involved with IT. The
primary task of any IT group is to teach people how to work. That's may
sound authoritarian, but it's not. IT's job at the most fundamental
level is to build, maintain and improve frameworks within which to
accomplish tasks. You may not view a Web server as a framework to
accomplish tasks, but it does automate the processes of advertising,
sales, informing and entertaining, all of which would otherwise be done
in other ways. IT groups literally teach and reteach the world how to
work. That's the job.

When you understand the mission of IT, it isn't hard to see why
co-workers and supervisors are judged severely according to their
abilities to contribute to that process. If someone has to constantly be
taught Computers 101 every time a new problem presents itself, he can't
contribute in the most fundamental way. It is one thing to deal with
that from a co-worker, but quite another if the people who represent IT
to the organization at large aren't cognizant of how the technology
works, can't communicate it in the manner the IT group needs it
communicated, can't maintain consistency, take credit for the work of
the group members, etc. This creates a huge morale problem for the
group. Executives expect expert advice from the top IT person, but they
have no way of knowing when they aren't getting it. Therein lies the
problem.

IT pros know when this is happening, and they find that it is impossible
to draw attention to it. Once their work is impeded by the problem, they
will adopt strategies and behaviors that help circumvent the issue. That
is not a sustainable state, but how long it takes to deteriorate can be
days, months or even years.


      How to fix it

So, if you want to have a really happy, healthy and valuable IT group, I
recommend one thing: Take an interest. IT pros work their butts off for
people they respect, so you need to give them every reason to afford you
some.

You can start with the hiring process. When hiring an IT pro, imagine
you're recruiting a doctor. And if you're hiring a CIO, think of
employing a chief of medicine. The chief of medicine should have many
qualifications, but first and foremost, he should be a practicing
doctor. Who decides if a doctor is a doctor? Other doctors! So, if your
IT group isn't at the table for the hiring process of their bosses and
peers, this already does a disservice to the process.

Favor technical competence and leadership skills. Standard managerial
processes are nearly useless in an IT group. As I mentioned, if you've
managed to hire well in the lower ranks of your IT group, the staff
already know how to manage things. Unlike in many industries, the fight
in most IT groups is in how to get things done, not how to avoid work.
IT pros will self-organize, disrupt and subvert in the name of
accomplishing work. An over-structured, micro-managing, technically
deficient runt, no matter how polished, who's thrown into the mix for
the sake of management will get a response from the professional IT
group that's similar to anyone's response to a five-year-old tugging his
pants leg.

What IT pros want in a manager is a technical sounding board and a
source of general direction. Leadership and technical competence are
qualities to look for in every member of the team. If you need someone
to keep track of where projects are, file paperwork, produce reports and
do customer relations, hire some assistants for a lot less money.

When it comes to performance checks, yearly reviews are worthless
without a 360-degree assessment. Those things take more time than a
simple top-down review, but it is time well spent. If you've been paying
attention to what I've been telling you about how IT groups behave and
organize, then you will see your IT group in a whole different light
when you read the group's 360s.

And make sure all your managers are practicing and learning. It is very
easy to slip behind the curve in those positions, but just as with
doctors, the only way to be relevant is to practice and maintain an
expertise. In IT, six months to a year is all that stands between
respect and irrelevance.

Finally, executives should have multiple in-points to the IT team. If
the IT team is singing out of tune, it is worth investigating the
reasons. But you'll never even know if that's the case if the only
information you receive is from the CIO. Periodically, bring a few key
IT brains to the boardroom to observe the problems of the organization
at large, even about things outside of the IT world, if only to make use
of their exquisitely refined BS detectors. A good IT pro is trained in
how to accomplish work; their skills are not necessarily limited to
computing. In fact, the best business decision-makers I know are IT
people who aren't even managers.

As I said at the very beginning, it's all about respect. If you can
identify and cultivate those individuals and processes that earn genuine
respect from IT pros, you'll have a great IT team. Taking an honest
interest in helping your IT group help you is probably the smartest
business move an organization can make. It also makes for happy,
completely non-geek-like geeks.
