  Introduction

The purpose of this document is to bring all parties involved with
Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
fighting up to speed on the attacks and mitigation approaches.


  DDoS Overview

A DoS is a denial of service attack where the end goal is to deny the
availability of a particular resource, either directly or indirectly. In
the old days, these types of attacks could often be carried out with a
minimal amount of resources, sometimes with no more than a single packet.

While these types of vulnerabilities still exist from time to time, the
most popular variant on a DoS is the DDoS wherein quality is replaced
with quantity, shear volume is the weapon of choice and is achieved
through distributing (the first D in DDoS) the work across many nodes.

In the majority of cases, the nodes selected to do the dirty work are
obtained first by compromising them through any number of methods and
then installing some manner of command and control mechanism from which
attacks can be launched in a distributed manner. The army of nodes under
the control of a malicious third party is referred to as a botnet. While
it is certainly the case that bots are sometimes specifically harvested
for a task at hand, botnets can be bought, rented or stolen just like
any other commodity. In fact, if you know the right people, a botnet can
rented for several hours for a price as low as several cents per node.

As for the actual attacks, I could write for days about how to attack
any protocol known to man (in fact, this was my job at one point in my
career), but a DDoS operates under one simple ideal: to deny, either
directly or indirectly, access to a particular resource. The majority of
the time this is done through consuming excessive resources on the
target, where a resource is most often something like bandwidth,
processing power, session limits, disk space, etc.


  DDoS Mitigation Techniques

The techniques most often used to combat or mitigate a DDoS attack are
generally compromised of one or more of the following, described in a
reasonable amount of depth in no particular order below.


      Wait it out

Sometimes a DDoS is launched simply to make a point and making a
resource unavailable for a period of time is the only goal. Often times,
the attacker has more resources available to them than a target could
ever expect to combat, and attempting to do so would be a silicon
melting, mind warping game of whack-a-mole that the target would
ultimately lose. In some cases, simply riding out the attack is the only
and best option.


      Run

If a business's technology and revenue model is supportive of this,
constantly (or until the attack goes away) running away from the attack
is a potential option. While this is entirely situation dependent,
generally the goal is to cause the attackers or their resources to work
unnecessarily hard to achieve their results by making yourself a moving
target. More specifically, this can include things like round robin DNS,
frequently changing IP addresses, hosting providers or even host names
frequently enough such that by the time the attack catches up to your
current location, you are already on the move.


      Pay Up

DDoS attacks are often done for direct or indirect financial gain on the
part of the attacker. Over the past several years, organised crime
syndicates, most notably the infamous RBN
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Business_Network>, have been
behind an unfortunate number of high-profile DDoS attacks and money is
often the goal. Direct financial gain in this case is similar to ransom
â€“ pay the attackers and they will go away. Indirect financial gain can
be obtained by, for example in the case of Edmunds, denying normal users
the ability to use Edmunds properties in the hopes that they'll flock to
a competitor. It is not unheard of for competitors to seek out DDoS
attacks as a means for obtaining more traffic by making a competitor
seem unappealing.


      Resource Increase

Because the core of a DoS/DDoS attack is preventing legitimate access to
a resource, logically a good choice for mitigation is to simply add more
resources. Resources could be any number of things, including:

    * Bandwidth. Most DDoS are in the 10-100Mbs range and will cripple
      most organisations, however multi-Gbs attacks are not unheard of.
    * Processing power. For example, the ability to process and
      subsequently pass or drop traffic can be greatly improved by
      having more processing power.
    * Connection/session limits. If a device can only handle X
      simultaneous connections, upgrading to a device that can handle
      2X, 3X or more is an option
    * Distribution. While arguably a variant on a combination of all of
      the above, if you distribute your resources far, wide and deep
      enough all over the globe, it is possible that the DDoS, while
      certainly annoying, may end up not hitting all of your resources
      thereby allowing legitimate users access.


      Pre-filtering

Pre-filtering is the practice of routing a portion or all of a target's
traffic through some sort of intermediate resource whose goal is to
inspect and selectively filter out traffic identified as malicious.
Companies like Akamai, Prolexic <http://www.prolexic.com> and Datapipe
<http://www.datapipe.com> have offerings in this space.


      Dedicated DDoS Appliance

Technically a variant of a resource increase, there are numerous
products out there (Arbor, Riorey, Intruguard, Mazu) that have purpose
built appliances whose only goal is to detect and drop a DDoS attack.
These are only effective if the resources upstream from the appliance
can sustain the attack, so in the case of Edmunds LAX1 infrastructures,
so long as Sprint, Internap and our 2 1Gpbs connections could sustain
the load, an appliance could theoretically detect and drop a DDoS. While
too technical to go into here, these appliances typically achieve their
results by one or more methods:

   1. Generic algorithms for detecting DDoS attacks, for example:
         1. HTTP Floods
         2. TCP SYN Floods
         3. UDP Floods
         4. Invalid IP/TCP/UDP checksum floods
         5. Invalid L3/L4 options
         6. (Re)Connection rates
   2. Custom, real-time intelligence that correlates inspected traffic
      with:
         1. Global abuse paterns
         2. Global black/white lists
         3. Known current/recent attack patterns


      Fight Back

While very rarely recommended, this approach has been used in the past
and has yielded results in some cases. Fighting back against a DDoS
often involves targeting the resources involved in causing the DDoS
(generally, the bots in the botnet) or the people/resources profiting
from the DDoS.
