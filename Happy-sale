For sale in SoCal Guards 911SC with factory whaletail

I have owned this car since 1999 and have all the documentation from that time.

Asking for $30k

This car has no leaks. It is solid, starts on the first try, idles well and is a pleasure to drive. 

The original paint is not perfect, I have used this car as a driver, so it has rock chips, but has a nice glossy depth to it. 

Odometer reads 187k

6000 miles ago a couple of cracked heads studs (common issue with the SC's) led to the 'right thing to do'.
