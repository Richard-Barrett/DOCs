PRINCE OF EGYPT THERE CAN BE MIRACLES LYRICS

Many night's we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood,
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
long before we knew we could

Miriam (chorus)

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

Tzipporah

Oi to the world by No Doubt

If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what he'd say
He'd say "Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
But Oi to the world and everybody wins"
