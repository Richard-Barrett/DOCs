*** You need to add entries to both the forward and reverse zones ***

 Currently, pl1rns702.admin.edmunds.com is the DNS server.
Forward Zone DNS

   1. Log into pl1rns702.admin.edmunds.com
   2. After your sudo, type prodnamed, this will put you in "/nfs/common/named/chroot-production"
   3. cd var/named/zones-forward (for editing forward maps)
   4. Backup file to the archives directory.  We currently use the following syntax for the backup: "<file name><your name><date>-<time>" ie cp db.admin.edmunds.com archives/db.admin.edmunds.com-jeff-nov1809-1154
   5. Edit the zone file
         1. Edit the second line, marked by "@  SOA".  You will see a series of number at the end of this line between 2 brackets.  The first set of 10 numbers in those brackets should reflect the date with 2 extra numbers.  Modify the first 8 number to the current date.  If you are making an additional change to a zone file that was already modified on the same day, update the last 2 numbers of that set of 10, to the next higher number.  IE: 2009111900 would be updated to 2009111901, etc.
         2. Add the entries at the bottom of the file.  Denote the date and your name (make sure it's commented out!) above your additions
         3. Of course, save your file after your are done.
   6. Find the PID for the named service and restart it.
         1. ps -ef | grep name
         2. kill -HUP <PID>  Don't forget the "-" before the "HUP" other wise you will kill the named service and get the stick.
   7. Verify that name service is still up ps -ef | grep name
   8. tail -f /var/log/messages and look for the zone with the correct SOA (from step 5).  This will verify that it's been updated.
   9. Verify that the correct IPs are resolving: host <server> 10.69.37.4 for the primary DNS seever.  
  10. Verify that the correct IPs are resolving: host <server> 10.69.37.7 for the slave DNS server.  

Reverse Zone DNS

   1. Log into pl1rns702.admin.edmunds.com
   2. After your sudo, type prodnamed, this will put you in "/nfs/common/named/chroot-production"
   3. cd var/named/zones-reverse
   4. Backup file to the archives directory.  We currently use the following syntax for the backup: "<file name><your name><date>-<time>" ie cp db.admin.edmunds.com archivesdb.admin.edmunds.com-jeff-nov1809-1154
   5. Edit the zone file.  This is different from "zones-forward" in that you are looking for the file for that specific subnet. ie db.10.96.205
         1. Edit the second line, marked by "@  SOA".  You will see a series of number at the end of this line between 2 brackets.  The first set of10 numbers in those brackets should reflect the date with 2 extra numbers.   Modify the first 8 number to the current date.  If you are making an additional change to a zone file that was already modified on the same day, update the last 2 numbers of that set of 10, to the next higher number.  IE: 2009111900 would be updated to 2009111901, ect
         2. Add the entries at the bottom of the file.  Denote the date and your name (make sure it's commented out!) above your additions
         3. Of course, save your file after your are done.
   6. Find the PID for the named service and restart it.
         1. ps -ef | grep name
         2. kill -HUP <PID>  Don't forget the "-" before the "HUP" other wise you will kill the named service and get the stick.
   7. Verify that name service is still up
   8. tail -f /var/log/messages and look for the zone with the correct SOA (from step 5).  This will verify that it's been updated.
   9. Verify that the correct IPs are resolving: "host <IP>".

COREZONES.CONF
pl1rns702.admin.edmunds.com://nfs/common/named/chroot-production/etc

One of the DNS configuration files is corezones.conf.  This file is a map of maps. 

In the example below we see that the "forward" mapping zone named "admin.edmunds.com" has a master file for that zone in zones-forward/db.admin.edmunds.com
       (this path assumes the starting point of /var/named.  We are in a chrooted location so logically this is the correct FQPN)

zone "admin.edmunds.com"    IN {type master;       file "zones-forward/db.admin.edmunds.com";};

There are also sections for "reverse" mapping.

zone "1.42.10.in-addr.arpa"    IN {type master;    file "zones-reverse/db.10.42.1";                };

Both forward and reverse entries are needed to to make the IP range available in DNS.

If the IP adress range you are adding is not in corezones.conf you must create/add the new IP for DNS to respond to it.  There are 4 places the you must add the new range.

    * pl1rns702.admin.edmunds.com /nfs/common/named/chroot-production/etc/corezones.conf
    * pl1rns702.admin.edmunds.com /nfs/common/named/chroot-preproduction/etc/corezones.conf
    * pl1rns703.admin.edmunds.com /nfs/common/named/chroot-production/etc/corezones.conf
    * pl1rns703.admin.edmunds.com /nfs/common/named/chroot-preproduction/etc/corezones.conf

As you add the new IP range you must kill -HUP <named PID> for each of the production and preproduction instaces on the primary DNS server (pl1rns702) and the slave DNS server (pl1rns703) in order to make the new IP range active.
