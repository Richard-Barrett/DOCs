To the best of my understanding, the driver stuff for the AJA cards resides in this folder:

/disney/depts/tech/soft/rv/aja_lic/ntv2linux-driver-12.4.1.1/bin

The standard process so far has been to cd into it and run sudo ./loadOEM2K

When I open up the loadOEM2K file I see some commands:

/sbin/insmod XENA2.ko    ##loads a kernal object

major=`cat /proc/devices | awk "\\$2==\"oem2k\" {print \\$1}"`     ##gets something called a 'major number'
rm -f /dev/oem2k[0-3]      ##removes any existing oem2k nodes
mknod /dev/oem2k0 c $major 0     ##recreates the oem2k nodes in /dev/
mknod /dev/oem2k1 c $major 1
mknod /dev/oem2k2 c $major 2
mknod /dev/oem2k3 c $major 3


My research tells me there should be a place to copy .ko kernel objects to be loaded on startup (supposedly something like /etc/modules) and there should be a place to specify to make certain nodes on startup (supposedly /lib/udev/devices). I can't find those places in our filesystems (or they exist but are empty of any other files) As I'm not familiar enough with the way our Linux installs handles these, I felt it best to consult you before I start mucking around with how the theater machines boot up. 

Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks

@@@going to try adding this to rc.local on dts3478

@@@ first tried by hand
/disney/depts/tech/soft/rv/aja_lic/ntv2linux-driver-12.4.1.1/bin/loadOEM2K
[root@dts3478 bin]# ll /dev | grep oem
crw-rw-rw-.  1 root root    244,   0 Jul 27 10:28 oem2k0
crw-rw-rw-.  1 root root    244,   1 Jul 27 10:28 oem2k1
crw-rw-rw-.  1 root root    244,   2 Jul 27 10:28 oem2k2
crw-rw-rw-.  1 root root    244,   3 Jul 27 10:28 oem2k3
[root@dts3478 bin]# cat /proc/devices | grep oem2k
244 oem2k

@@@ reboot to clear.... 

[root@dts3478 ~]# cat /etc/rc.local 

{SNIP}
#added as a test for theatre machines 27Jul17  --siggy
/disney/depts/tech/soft/rv/aja_lic/ntv2linux-driver-12.4.1.1/bin/loadOEM2K

@@@ that didn't work... suspect automount was not up yet

@@@ rc.local was a PITA to get working (never did...)
@@@ found a URL that suggested use @reboot in crontab
https://www.linuxbabe.com/linux-server/how-to-enable-etcrc-local-with-systemd

@@@failed had some permissions problems
@@@ the insmod failed until I put a FQPN in

[root@dts3478 ~]# crontab -l
@reboot /disney/depts/tech/soft/rv/aja_lic/ntv2linux-driver-12.4.1.1/bin/loadOEM2K

@@@ that works when tested by James
