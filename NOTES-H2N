When you run the cartog.bash script you see what appears to be an error in "INTERNAL" (see below)

NTERNAL
Warning: The global MX record(s) specified with the -m option(s) will
         not be generated due to the -M option also being specified.

 pl1rns703.admin.edmunds.com.	[no such name]  -s option

Done.

As far as I can tell this is due to teh strange combination of zones-reverse map sharing.  In h2n-options
the 2 "-s" (server) entries are complaining because the h2n script is told to ignore the admin.edmunds.com 
subdirectory with the "-p" entry.
