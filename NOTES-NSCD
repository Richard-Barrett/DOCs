2.1.4. The Name Service Caching Daemon

The Name Service Caching Daemon (NSCD) is used to cache name service lookups and can improve performance with the services provided by the NSS.

It must be tuned with a large cache for passwd entries in order to have acceptable performance on the client side.

It has some disadvantages however, like the introduction of cache inconsistencies, so you would want to be sure you need this before you use it. We have succesfully running some systems without it, and personally i think that it isn't really neccesary on relatively small systems.

nscd creates large number of file handels.  Need to update max_file_handles (or something like that)

I my experience service nscd restart does not clear NSCDâ€™s cache. service nscd reload does, however.

Important: The service nscd (name service caching daemon) interferes with 
proper functioning of winbind. Never run nscd on systems where winbindd 
runs.

Tune nscd to an appropriate minimal level. In particular, the configuration shall be modified so that passwd, group, and Solaris 8 (or later) Role-based access (RBAC) information is not cached. Disable caching of the RBAC attribute databases in Solaris 8 by adding the following lines to the /etc/nscd.conf file:
enable-cache exec_attr no
enable-cache prof_attr no
enable-cache user_attr no

nscd is a piece of junk. The idea is good, but for a decent implementation,
go for djbdns's dnscache.

Hey, for normal stuff djbdns might suck, but for caching it's absolutely
great. Except for IPv6 adresses of course.

a) Postfix is not CPU intensive
b) djbdns is restricted to a finite, fixed amount of memory. Ditch nscd and
   you have that x MB's of main memory left

This is true. Unfortunately, securing and updating the system because of the
bugs is tedious.

On Solaris, a lot of things break when nscd is not running, but it has very
little added value. I have installed caching nameservers on DNS intensive
Solaris servers a number of times, just to get the extra bit performance. On
linux, I guess you'd be safe to rm nscd, without any noticable performace
hit...
