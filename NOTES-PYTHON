gzip-compressed source code: Python-2.5.4.tgz

bzip2-compressed source code: Python-2.5.4.tar.bz2, the source archive.

The bzip2-compressed version is considerably smaller, so get that one if your system has the appropriate tools to deal with it.

Unpack the archive with tar -zxvf Python-2.5.4.tgz (or bzcat Python-2.5.4.tar.bz2 | tar -xf -). Change to the Python-2.5.4 directory and run the "./configure", "make", "make install" commands to compile and install Python. The source archive is also suitable for Windows users who feel the need to build their own version.

Find a new release of python-ldap:

  http://python-ldap.sourceforge.net/

python-ldap provides an object-oriented API to access LDAP directory
servers from Python programs. It mainly wraps the OpenLDAP 2.x libs for
that purpose. Additionally it contains modules for other LDAP-related
stuff (e.g. processing LDIF, LDAPURLs and LDAPv3 schema).

Note that the download page has changed recently. You can now find the
source distribution at PyPI:

  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-ldap/

Ciao, Michael.
