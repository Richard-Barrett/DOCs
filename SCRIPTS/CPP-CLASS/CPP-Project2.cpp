C/C++ Project #2

Requirements:

Design a virtual array class.  The class will provide data from an array whose elements 
are in memory (compare to existing search) or on disk (new search).  The [] will be over 
loaded so that accessing the data is transparent to the client (program).  The array 
dimension will be users defined and of type int.

Design:

Constraints:

Useage:

int main (int size_of_slice, char *argv[])
{
FILE *source-file, *dest-file; // open source file for reading, and dest file for writing 
                               //passed to class

int number    //vArray data (slice) size








}
