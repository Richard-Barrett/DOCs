Don,
	As a starting point - start with a class definition with the
data and types of functions you will need to implement this virtual
array.  Then begin implementing the functions (constructor and overload
function - int& operator[] (int index);).  I promise to give some major
hints in tomorrow nights class.  It is OK to use a temporary file
although you do not really need one.  It might be a good idea for you to
implement the COMPLEX class version with the + overload function that is
in the notes - just to begin understanding the class and overload
concepts.  Then after tomorrow nights class you can tackle the virtual
array class.

	See you tomorrow night.

	Pat=20

Greetings

I'm looking for a good starting point.  I know I am behind (missing a
week), but I'd like to buy a clue ;^)

I'm not sure where to start on this assignment.  My first thought was to
start with reading (and trying to develop) an array.  While reading I
thought I should be concentrating on a function, when I started reading
about functions I came upon classes.  Then back to array(s).  Round and
round I go...

Where should I start?

Another question:

Under requirements, you state "...and utilize the file for the array
storage." =20
With the assumption that this class could be used to inspect a file on
disk.  Is it OK to use a temporary file for any changes (JUST to protect
the original
(input) file)?

THANKS

Don Siegfriedt
