Introduction
============

dsh, distributed shell, issues commands to groups of machines
in parallel.

dsh, as far as I know, first appeared in IBM's PSSP package for
the SP2 platform.  This is a re-implementation of dsh as described
in the PSSP 3.5 manual.

dsh can be used as a generic queueing system for any command
that needs to be run repeatedly for a group of hosts using the
DSH_REMOTE_CMD, DSH_PATH environment variables and the -o command
line option.

The interactive command line shell is very limited at the moment
and needs many features to be added.

The man page for dsh is still incomplete and needs improvement.

The man page for dshbak is little more than a stub at this time.

Autoconf needs to handle the selection of perl for dshbak and
to make sure the requirement for Digest::MD5 is met.
