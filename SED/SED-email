Subject: RE:RE:End of File
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Thank-you all for your assistance.

I now have it where I run three scripts.

First I use:

sed -f add file_in > file_out1

The add script looks like;

$ a\
end

Then I used this line from the one-liners

sed = file_out1 | sed 'N;s/\n/\ /' > file_out2

This numbers the lines and places a space between the line number and the rest of the line.

Finally I use the modifytxt script

sed -f modifytxt file_out2 > file_out3

Where modifytxt contains;

s/^[ \	]*//;s/[ \	]*$//
/[ \	]/s/[ \	]/,/g

This replaces any tabs or spaces with a comma.

I know I can join the first step with the last step into one script but I can't figure out how to place the second step into the other scripts. Is it possible to write this so I can run only one script?

sed -f newscript file_in > file_out

Many thanks,
Conrad

The function of all N-P-D loops is to create a sliding window, in 
which lines are collected into the pattern space in a FIFO stack 
(first in, first out), always being added to the end of the stack by 
the N command, and popped off the top of the stack by the P;D; 
commands.

In other words, we create a multi-line pattern space by use of the N 
and ba (branch to label :a) commands. At line #4 we still haven't 
printed anything, and only by line #4 do we reach the P; and D; 
commands, when we print only the first line. So, we're always 3 lines 
"behind" in our printing.

At the last line of the file, we're still 3 lines behind in printing. 
But the $d means to delete the pattern space, so the effect is the 
delete the last 3 lines of the file, which is the original request.

Hi Jim,

I would use awk here:

awk '$1 !~ /^$/'  file_name

would give me all lines but blank.


Hope this helps

  with ssed in win2k (or NT)
  i have a file that has multiple occurrences of lines like this:

  XLEAR                       00019.95

       [3 to 5 blank lines here]


  **KEY**

  i need to get rid of all the 'blank' lines between the XLEAR and the 
  **KEY**

  the only way i seem to be able to 'match the lines is with 
  /^ *$/   (there must be some other whitespace characters embedded in 
  them..)

  i have tried
  /XLEAR/{
           N
           /^ *$/d
  }

  but no go.... (also tried the D...)

  any thoughts of how i could do this?

  thanks!

Hi Gray,
    the core of sed uses so called "regular expressions" for
describing text patterns. That's probably why you not found the
answer in man sed. Try man regexp instead.

Just for now and too briefly about: 
sed 's/\(.*\)/set cs1=\1\n/'<clientcase.txt>clientcase.bat

Escaped parenthesis stands for "grouping" = collecting the content
described inside. It allows to make a backreference for the group 
in replacement string, later.
.* is the mask describing  whole line in this context. In the 
fact . is "any character" and * is "repeating sign, expand so far 
as possible".

sed 's/.*Clients\\\(....\).*\\\(....\).*/set cs2=\1.\2\n/'
and 
"J:\__Clients\1570_PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE\0290 GuideOne vs. Boak"

First two backslashes stand for one backslash after Clients.
Next, there is backslashed group of four universal characters (yes,
you've right . is one universal character, here .... catches 1570).
Next .* matches _PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE , than \\ matches \.
Next, \(....\) catches 0290 and .* is the rest of line.

I suggest you to look around for regular expression description (some
book?),  because despite of their weirdnes they are usefull not only
for sed, but for  grep, perl, awk and so on as well.

Regards

Jan

-----Original Message-----

I'm having trouble teching myself SED -- even the most basic
concepts.
Someone here was kind enough to write me a batchfile which contains
two SED
command lines. The problem is, that even though I have read the
manual
(actualy, more than one), I'm still confused.

The first line goes like this:
   sed 's/\(.*\)/set cs1=\1\n/'<clientcase.txt>clientcase.bat

Ok, so the 's/ that appears in the beginning is:

	s/regexp/replacement/
          Attempt to match regexp against the pattern space.   If
successful,
          replace  that portion matched with replacement.  The
replacement may
          contain the special character & to refer  to  that  portion
of the
          pattern  space  which matched, and the special escapes \1
through \9
          to refer  to  the  corresponding  matching  sub-expressions
in the
          regexp.

So what this is searching for is what's between the first
forward-slash
("/") and the second one and what it's replacing it with this what's
between
the second and the third forward-slash. So far, so good. But what
exactly is
it seaching for?

<><><> What does "\(.*\)" (ommitting quotation marks) mean?

The manual says that a back-slash "\" is used to escape certain
characters,
such as a forward-slash when you want to search for it instead of
having it
end a search or replacement string, or the ampersand ("&") when you
don't
want it to serve as a symbol for sub-expressions. But here the
back-slach
preceeds a left-parenthesis ("(") and the manual makes no mention of
the
left paren. having any special purpose. Then comes the dot (".") and
asterisk ("*"). Again, I can't find that the manual makes them any
sort of
meta-characters or gives them any special purpose. Next, we see the
escaped
right-parenthesis (")"). Once again, I don't know why it is escaped.

Moving on to the replacement string, I gather that it is writing the
text
"set cs1=" followed by whatever it found (search string one,
identified by
"\1") followed by a hard return, identifed by \n', to a file which it
creates and saves as clientcase.bat.

The second SED line is:
sed 's/.*clients\\\(....\).*\\\(....\).*/set cs2=\1.\2\n/'

Ok, here we have another S command. We must be searching for
".*clients\\\(....\).*\\\(....\).*" (again, omitting quotation
marks). Now,
I know what the seach string is going to be (typically, something
like
"J:\__Clients\1570_PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE\0290 GuideOne vs. Boak"), I
just
can't understand why this finds it is looking for (the 1570 and the
0290).
Does "*" or ".*" stand as universal characters? Why is the single
backslash
we're looking for have to be double escaped as "\\\"? What is
"(....\)"?  I
know that this is supposed to be seaching for two strings, but for
the life
of me I can't see where or how. The manual mentions searching for
subexpressions, but doesn't explain how you do that -- at least that
I can
see.

You asked for it.
Well, stuff already written is hard to read in sed and bash!
And, I am an amateur, so its all amateur work.
The tools to understand are:
sed, tr, cut, sort, join, paste, nl, grep, xargs, and others.

Here is a set of scripts which illustrate some of this stuff.
I run a script each day to look at my firewall logs, and find which ports
were accessed and by whom.

The firewall log, in /var/log/messages, looks like this:

Aug 22 19:30:33 hammer2 kernel: Packet log: input DENY eth1 PROTO=17 12.72.25.171:4940 68.33.11.210:135 L=243 S=0x00 I=12253 F=0x0000 T=112 (#51)    
Aug 18 08:33:47 hammer2 kernel: Packet log: input - eth1 PROTO=6 12.215.49.67:1126 68.33.11.210:80 L=48 S=0x00 I=42555 F=0x4000 T=113 SYN (#3)          
Imagine messages to be a spreadsheet composed of numerous columns of
data separate by blanks.

The report I get looks like this:

Sun Aug 18 23:55:00 EDT 2002
This shows only today's activity (calendar date)
Source_IP: 10.133.184.1      Port    68 eth1 ACCEPT     input
Source_IP: 12.215.49.67      Port    80 eth1 -          input

*** hammer2.jhammer.org can't find 12.215.49.67: Non-existent host/domain
 
Address:  192.168.0.2
 
Name:    bs1.sjc.mirrorimage.net
Address:  128.242.107.15
 
Address:  192.168.0.2
 
The command which runs this is:
/root/LookupFire | /usr/local/bin/mutt  -s "Daily Firewall Probes" jlh  

Script LookupFire
date | tr -s " "
echo "This shows only today's activity (calendar date)"
/usr/local/bin/fire $1 | grep "`date |  tr -s " "  | cut -d\  -f2,3`" | grep Packet \
        | cut -d" " -f8,9,10,12,13  | tr \: " "  | cut -d" " -f1,2,3,4,7 | sed 's/ /\:/4' \
        | sort -u | tr \: " " \
        | sed 's/^\(.* \)\(.* \)\(.* \)\(.* \)\(.*\)$/Source_IP: \4 Port \5 \3 \2 \1/' \
        | xargs -n7 printf "%-10s %-15s   %4s %5s %4s %-7s %8s\n" | sort
/usr/local/bin/fire $1 | grep "`date | tr -s " " | cut -d\  -f2,3`" | grep Packet \
                       | cut -d" " -f12 | cut -d\: -f1 | sort -u | xargs -n1 nslookup > \
                       /root/junk.dat 2>&1
cat /root/junk.dat  | grep  -v Server | grep -v 127.0.0.1


Script /usr/local/bin/fire
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$1" = "" ];then
     file="messages"
   else
     file=$1
fi  
cat /var/log/$file | grep Packet  \
       | tr -s " "

So, what happens?
When LookupFire is called it
Calls fire, which just specifies the log file
fire finds all lines with Packets and removes any double or triple spaces
fire feed these line into the first ugly expression which:
1.  Uses a grep command to find only entries for todays date. It does this
using the date command and tr -s to get out the blanks. Then, the cut
command inserts the two fields to use in the search expression.
2.  The grep Packet appears to be redunant!
3.  The cut command leaves in only a few columns of interest.
4.  The : are changed to " " so the ports are now just one more column of
data. 
I could go on, but you get the idea.  Build up your scripts one tiny
step at at time.
Now, I suspect an expert sedder could do this more succinctly, but, if I
were going to do it again, I would be much more verbose and simple in what I
did.
Enjoy!
Joel

Hi Harm,
  Thanks for your help, I forget to tell this while posting,
I already used the 2 options you suggested, the problem is when the values are expanded, it combines 2 lines into single lines hence the 
sed command is not working. I need an alternative to insert in a text file in a shell script.

thanks

I don't know about elegant, but

	sed 'h; y/ /_/; G; s/\("[^"]*"\).*\n"[^"]*"/\1/'

seems to do the trick.

Oh, I assumed that the first field would always be quoted. Anyway,
comma-separated is very similar

	sed 'h; y/ /_/; G; s/^\([^,]*\),.*\n[^,]*,/\1,/'

Of course. Here is the program below, with comments interspersed:

h			# copy pattern space to hold space
y/ /_/			# transliterate all spaces to underscores in
			# pattern space
G			# append hold space to pattern space to
			# pattern space
	# at this point, the pattern sapce consists of
	# <line w/ _ instead of spaces><newline><original line>

s/^\([^,]*\),.*\n[^,]*,/\1,/'

. matches any character except newline, so the expression matches \1
as the first field (saving it for later), then the rest of the
transliterated line up to the embedded newline plus another field
(which is the first field from the original line that we saved in the
hold space).

It replaces all of this with \1, which is the first field but
transliterated. The rest of the line isn't matched in the
substitution, so it is left as-is, consisting of the original line
minus the first field, so

	<1st field transliterated><rest of tr fields>\n<1st
	field><rest of fields>

becomes

	<1st field transliterated><rest of fields>

This command has a couple of problems:

1) The correct syntax for a back-substitution is s/\( ... \)/\1/,
     note the escaped parantheses. In this case, you could use "&"
     instead which represents the whole match, ie s/.*/&/.

2) You don't need to escape ";"

I'm not completely sure what you mean here, so I am going to assume
that you want to select certain parts of the file, based on the
XML-like tags.

To select a multi-line field you can do something like this (the
example extracts the body):
-------
/<body>/!b			# branch to end if not <body>-tag
:a
N				# append next input line
/<\/body>/!ba			# repeat apending lines until ending
				#   tag is seen
s/<body>\(.*\)<\/body>/\1/p	# extract everything between the tags
-------

To extract a single-line field, you can do like this

	sed -n 's/.*<issuevol>//p'

I'm assuming that you mean you want to delete this line; otherwise,
what do you want to substitute it with?

If I'm correct in this, you can simply do this:

	sed '/static final int whatever/d'

IOW, you need to include enough of the line to uniquely distinguish
it from the rest, and then perform the delete (d) command on it.

Since you are deleting the whole line, there is no need to explicitly
match the beginning or end of the line, as long as it's uniquely
determined.

In bash, you can get a tab by doing Ctrl-V Ctrl-I.

I think that this is an instance of the `greedy vs. stingy matching'
problem.  The Perl regular expression manpage explains it well, and I think
that so does Eric's sed FAQ.

Moving to last:

	# to be invoked with -n
	/<pattern>/H
	/<pattern/!p
	${
		x
		s/^\n//
		p
		}

Moving to first:

	# to be invoked with -n
	/<pattern>/p
	/<pattern/!H
	${
		x
		s/^\n//
		p
		}

Note that moving to first keeps the non-matching lines in the hold
buffer, which means that the size of the hold buffer will limit the
size of the files that can be edited.

It would be very helpful if you can provide us with an example of
your desired output. Otherwise I can't be of more help.

1) I think it has.

2) I think you cannot.

3) I think that find is more similar to fgrep, so it makes sense that it
prints a kind of header, like fgrep does when specifying multiple files.
Problem is, it prints it even when a single file is searched.

In fact only ^[ is a special char, but I have no idea how to

Perfect. Thank you,  Thobias. It seems that this list teaches me 
unix as well as sed!

man listen | col -b | sed 's/[0-9]*m//g' | a2ps -o listen.ps

works like a dream. It'd be nice if someone could show me how to 
remove ^[ special char with sed though ;-)

Regards,
Angus

Cheers, Vlad. Can't do that here, but this works:

gunzip -c /usr/share/man/man2/listen.2.gz | groff -T ps -man > 
listen.ps

But it'd still be nice to know how to remove special chars like 
^[ with sed.

the ^[ aka CTRL-[ aks ESC can be removed like this:

  use a literal ESC:
  sed -e 's///g'

  or use \e :
  sed -e 's/\e//g'

This may not be the most elegant solution and it certainly is not a sed solution however it will work if you have grep and head available.  Next time please include your OS at least.

grep 'emailid' <filename> | head -1

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

This script prints out only the first occurrence of a pattern

/pattern/{
p
q
}

You could make this more flexible with:
/pattern{
p
:loop
n
bloop
}
Then, you would have the option of working with additional lines in the file
if you want, after the first match. Or, if you wanted to work with lines
before the first match, too, for example, to print out everything up to the first
match, this might work:

/pattern{
p
:loop
n
bloop
}
p


The command to use is:  sed -n -f script file

Try:
grep "993 " file

This would work nicely with:
sed -n "/^993/p"

Hi Kray

In brackets a LITERAL Tab (with vi: [Ctrl]+[V]+[Tab]) plus a [SPACE].

On my Solaris system this works fine:
$ echo "993 777\n992 abc\n993 123" | sed -n '/^993/s/[	 ].*//p'
993
993

This will also remove everything after 993

To cut of everything but the first 3 figures:
$ echo "993 777\n992 abc\n993 123" | sed 's/[	 ].*//'
993
992
993

CU,
Roland

You need to delete lines that do not start with 993:

/^993/!d

The caret ^ matches the start of the line (or, more specifically, the start of the pattern space).  This will also catch lines that start with "9931" etc: obviously if you want to add a space to the pattern that might do more what you want.

Best wishes,
Stew

You say you want to "just select" or "grab" this first occurrence, but given that you know what the occurrence is, and that this first occurrence will be the same as any other occurrence, wouldn't you achieve your objective by simply testing whether the pattern is present in the file?

[Assuming POSIX shell:]
grep -q '<emailid>' file && echo '<emailid>'

If I've missed the point feel free to get back to me.  Best wishes,
Stew

Using GNU grep:

    grep -m1 "pattern" file

Using sed:

    sed -n "/pattern/{p;q;}" file

In both cases, this prints the whole line. If you want
something less than that, say so.

What was the command-line you used? Please be EXACT in the command
line that you used. Do you use CMD.EXE or COMMAND.COM as your
shell under Microsoft Windows?

What error message did you receive?

Your first step should be to read the error message, look at
what you passed to sed, and try to figure out where you went
wrong. The error message usually tells you, especially if you
are using GNU sed or ssed. If you are running a DOS session under
Windows, you can even capture the text of the message by right
clicking on the icon in the top left corner of the window
(where the blue bar is), and then selecting EDIT. I assume that
you know how to cut-and-paste from there on, right?

Finally, did you remember to use the -f switch when passing 
the script filename to sed? That is, the command should be:

   sed -f yourscript.sed yourfile

and to print the output to another file:

   sed -f yourscript.sed yourfile >another.file

Let me know how this works.

Subject: ssed 3.59 released
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

ssed 3.59 has been released on http://sed.sf.net/grabbag

* `R' command reads a single line from a file.

* CR-LF pairs are always ignored under Windows, even if (under Cygwin)
  a disk is mounted as binary.

* Fixed bug in the numeric parameter to `s'.  The replacement flag
  was set on the first match of the regular expression, not on the Nth.

* Fixed bug in /.{1,64}/

* More attention to errors on stdout

* New `W' command to write first line of pattern space to a file

Also, as somebody might know, I'm now maintainer of GNU sed.  I will do soon
a 4.0 release that features the new GNU implementation of regular
expressions and all of ssed's features except, maybe, Perl regexps.  I don't
know yet if the new GNU regex routines implement them -- if they do, then
ssed will simply morph into GNU sed 4.0, if they don't, then it will be the
only feature that distinguishes GNU sed 4.0 from ssed.

The release will be preceded by a probably-not-so-short period of beta
testing, since GNU sed should be able to configure the Linux kernel, the GNU
tools, and a lot of other stuff.

Subject: a query
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hello all,

I have a file with several columns. I want to insert after the first column
five identical fields for every record and do some processing. Then I want
to be able to remove these five fields from each record. An example follows:


467    3 1  4 2 5 5

I want to insert    1 0 0 1 2 after 467 and after I processed the file want
to be able to remove these intermediary fields.

Regards,
Hassan

hi there,

assuming all columns are tab seperated,

sed -e 's/\(^[0-9]*\t\)\(.*$\)/\11\t0\t0\t1\t2\t\2/g' <file>
            ---------    ---   - --------------  -
			a            b     c  d              e

	a: select 1st column + tab
	b: select all other columns
	c: paste column 1 + tab
	d: paste 1<tab>0<tab>0<tab>1<tab>2<tab>
	e: paste rest of columns

with \t being entered by <ctrl-v tab>

the pasted 10012 column can be similarly removed.

regards,
kartik

I would look into cut, paste, and join.
Sed is not really too good at columns.

If the text is in file.txt:

You asked:

> get all the text.
 
Is it possible for 1023 and 1099 to both occur on the same line?
 
If yes, can they appear in either order or (if yes), do they always appear in the same order?

If the two numbers never occur on the same line, this will do what you want.

s/.*1023//p
 tloop1
 b
 :loop1
  n 
 :loop2
  s/1099.*//p
  t
  p
  n
 bloop2
  
  
It exploits the fact the the t branching command only works after a
successful substitution. And, you don't have to write sed scripts on one
line.
The command is:
sed -n -f script file
If the numbers can occur on the same line, say something like:
blah 1023 good stuff 1099 blah blah 1023
good stuff two 1099 blah blah 1023 and so on,
then you'll have to use the N command and read in lines until you get 1023
and 1099 in the same pattern space, print the intervening text, and start
over. It might be more complicated to figure out.

# invoke with '-n'
/1023/!b

:a
N
/1099/!ba

s/.*1023//
s/1099.*//p


This will handle multiple-line targets as well as with the markers on
the same line. It will fail on two consecutive same-line marker pairs
though.

Subject: Delete lines using 'sed'
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I want to delete multiple set of lines from a file. For that I am using
the following sed command

sed ' 1,16 d
66,81 d
123,138 d
170,185 d
    .
    .
    .
10164,10179 d
10206,10221 d
10245,10260 d ' <file>

When delete commands(eg.0245,10260 d)  > 120 lines then getting error
message "Too many line numbers". No problems for delete commands < 120.
Can anyone help me to get rid of this error and get desired output for
> 120 delete commands.

Thanks,
Seetaram

Subject: multiple line parsing with sed?
Reply-To: jaytschneider@yahoo.com
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   


Hello,

   I was wondering if sed can match and return multiple lines in a file.  I am trying to parse a log file that is a not standard anything in any way.

ex.

[10:20:54 Sept. 24, 2002] this is text
some more text
<foo bar="aimee">
   <moo>
      someclass.class
   </moo>
</foo>
[10:21:00 Sept. 24, 2002] again some more text
[10:21:01 Sept. 24, 2002] and again some more text

I would like to parse out the bit of text that looks like xml.  Can I do this with sed?  

Thanks,

Jay

Sure: you can append the next line to the pattern space using the N command.

Yes, but you'd need to programmatically define how you identify the section as being XML.  Maybe you want to delete everything between the first "<" and the last ">"?  Would that be sensible?

Best wishes,

I don't think sed is the way to go.
I would use cut to get each column into its own file, sort them in reverse

sed is not really appropriate for this task, since it doesn't have
any arithmetics abilities. This kind of problem fits awk best, like
in this awk program

{ for(i=1; i<=NF; i++)
    if (max[i] < $i) max[i] = $i
}
END { for(i=1; i<=NF; i++)
          printf "%d ", max[i]
      printf "\n"
}

Not being a sed expert, what I would try is:

awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++)a[i]+=$i;j=NF}END{for(i=1;i<=j;i++)printf("%s
",a[i]);print}' filename

or something similar

I don't think sed is the way to go.
I would use cut to get each column into its own file, sort them in reverse
order, save just the first row, and join or print them.

Hi Kray

Imaging this in numbers.txt (separated by tabs), I added one more 
line to your original:
1	2	3	5
2	2	2	2
4	6	7	5
3	5	8	9

On Solaris 8 this works fine and is probably what you need:

$ sort -nr numbers.txt | sed -n 1p
4       6       7       5

Additional info:
If you want it sorted by the 3nd column as primary c., use

$ sort -k3 -nr numbers.txt | sed -n 1p
3       5       8       9


CU,
Roland

Hi all,

GNU sed version 3.02

I want to handle some newlines with sed.

I've got:
for i in `ls */*.html`; do
sed -e "s/^<!--Navigation.*of Navigation Panel-->//" $i > ($i).bak;
done;

Obviously I need some treatment of newlines there, the man pages
are confusing.
I want to take all html files one directory down, generated by latex2html
they have navigation panels that I don't need and wish to remove.

example_file.html:
////////////////////
start of file...
...
<BODY >
<!--Navigation Panel-->
//unkown number
//of unneeded
//lines, including the
//marker lines above and
//below
<--End of Navigation Panel-->
...
rest of file
///////////////////

any help much appreciated.

regards,
Jan

To remove everything between and including two lines

	/pattern matching first line/,/pattern matching last line/d

To remove lines, but where you want to keep portions of the first &
last lines

	/match of first line/!b
	:a
	N
	/match of last line/!ba

	s/match of first line.*match of last line//

Subject: Help with an expression
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

        Hi, everyone. I am new to this group, also new to sed. I 
never liked it because I didn't know about the -r switch, and hated 
the idea of having to escape parentheses, quantifiers etc. Now that I 
know about the -r switch, I'm having lots of fun with it. I'm having 
much more fun with super-sed, actually, because I love PCRE. Well, 
here is my problem:
        I have a collection of sed programs I got from the Web. 
They're all supposed to run without the -r switch. I want to make 
them all run with the switch, ie convert all their REs into extended 
REs. I've come up with this expression:
        (?x) (  [^\\] ) (  \\  ) (  [|?+{}<>\(\)]  )
        replace it with \1\3

        If you don't like PCRE, here it is:
        ([^\\])(\\)([|?+{}<>\(\)])
        replace it with \1\3

        The command, then, is:
        ssed -R "s/([^\\])(\\)([|?+{}<>\(\)])/\1\3/g"

        So I took a random sample script and ran it through ssed:

	# lowercase heading tags
	s/\(<\/\{0,1\}\)[Hh]\([0-7]\)/\1h\2/g
	# strip characters up to opening tag
	G
	s/<h\([0-7]>\)\(.*\)\(.\)$/\3\1\2/
	s/.*\n/<h/

        ... and the result is:

	# lowercase heading tags
	s/(<\/{0,1}\)[Hh]([0-7])/\1h\2/g
	# strip characters up to opening tag
	G
	s/<h([0-7]>)\(.*)\(.)$/\3\1\2/
	s/.*\n/<h/

        You see, I can't make that slash right after {0,1} go away. 
I've spent almost an hour trying many REs, but can't figure out what 
is wrong. Any input will be appreciated.

        Thank you,
        Luciano ES
        Santos, SP - Brasil

Maybe

s/([^\\]*)(\\)([|?+{}<>\(\)])/\1\3/g

with the asterisk?  Otherwise you fail when you have two *consecutive*

Hi,
I want to strip off columns 21-24,27-32,41-42,45-54 from a file and print
out the rest. I know I can write an awk command, but I have to nullify every
single column. I try to use cut, but couldn't put it right. I wonder if you
can give me some easy way to do this easy but cumbersome task!!

Subject: substring extraction example
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:  O

After a little reading about sed, this is the best I can do to 
extract substrings matching /[0-9A-F]{5} [0-9A-F]{4}/ contained 
within longer strings:

cat txt | sed -n -E 's/[0-9A-F]{5} [0-9A-F]{4}/<&>/p' |
    sed -E 's/^.*<//;s/>.*$//'

Is it really this hard?  Basically, I bracketed my desired substring 
in <> and then called sed again to throw away everything not in the 
<>.  I could not figure out how to make sed print the matched portion 
stored in the & variable.

No, it can be made shorter (GNU sed or ssed required):

   sed -r 's/.*([0-9A-F]{5} [0-9A-F]{4}).*/\1/' txt

and with ssed you can shave off 2 more characters:

   sed -R 's/.*([\dA-F]{5} [\dA-F]{4}).*/\1/' txt

Note that this extracts only the last match on a line, and throws all 
other matches away. To get the first match, change the first ".*" to 
".*?" (perl style minimal matching).

Subject: delete duplicate lines (revisited)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:  O

Dear seders:

  To emulate 'sort datafile | uniq',
  I wrote the following script, although this topic was discussed before.

  [1] 1!G
  [2] /^\([^\n]*\)\(\n[^\n]*\)*\n\1\(\n[^\n]*\)*$/d
  [3] h
  [4] P
  [5] d

 1.The script uses the Hold Space (abbreviated to HS later) to keep the
   unique lines found so far, separated by new line characters. 
 2.Step [1] will append the HS to the Pattern Space(abbreviated to PS
   later). 1! means that this step will be performed except for the first
   line of some file. Without 1!, this script will not output the first
   empty line if it exists. 
 3.After Step [1], the PS may contains several lines, which begins with the 
   current line, followed by unique lines found so far. If the current line
   is a duplicate of some other line, we use the command 'd' to start a new 
   cycle. 
 4.Otherwise, we have to 
   +------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | print the current line | note that the current line is the first |                          
   |                        | line of PS, therefore use command 'P'   |
   +------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | update HS              | note that PS now contains exactly what  |
   |                        | we want, since it has all the unique    |
   |                        | lines found so far plus the current     |
   |                        | line, so we use command 'h'             |
   +------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | start a new cycle      |use command 'd'                          |
   +------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

  Any comments will be appreciated.

Since other people answered your question already, I only ask... what's -E?
It seems to trigger extended regexps, but in which version of sed?

	Hi,
	I just made this line:
	-e "/some pattern/,/another pattern/w c:\some\path\removed.txt" -e "/some
pattern/,/another pattern/d"
	
	So I want to delete all lines in a given interval, but first I want to
save the deleted lines in a file, so I have a chance to check if I am
removing the right thing. Because I am using w, I understand I have to use
-e twice. Saying "d;w file" doesn't work. But I also have to specify the
interval twice. Is it correct or is there a shorter way?

========================================================

I think I found the syntax I was looking for.
This is a slightly different example,
but notice the \1 \2 \3 below.

cat list.txt | sed -n -E \
's/^[ \t]+([0-9]+)[ \t]+([0-9A-F]{5}) ([0-9A- F]{4}).*$/\1 \2 \3/p'

Each \n corresponds to the nth parenthesized
portion of the preceeding regular expression.

I found both the manual and the man pages to be abit unclear about
this, so I messed around with it for a bit myself, and I found that
using the below works when saved to a file first and executed with
"sed -f ..."

	/pattern1/,/pattern2/{
		w saved-text.txt
		d
	}

It seems that the w command takes everything up to a newline to be
the name of the file, and that is why it doesn't work using ";" as
statement separator. You can still do it as a "one-liner" though, you
just have to enter a newline like in the script above instead of
using ";". (When trying with semicolons as statement separators I got
an error message, and I found that output file got the name "file; d;
}" instead.)

so - is this "ssed 4.0" - or even "GNU sed 4.0"?

i just hope that all these pages will
now hand out the same kind of sed:

http://freshmeat.net/projects/sed
http://www.gnu.org/directory/sed.html
http://queen.rett.polimi.it/~paolob/seders/ssed

it's getting a bit confusing now...

Subject: Newbie question: Getting a substring
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Dear sed-users

I have a file containing strings like

...t/home/egav/ega-v-t/90002877920021021294301TV.DAT:   33.79 kB   49.88
kB/s  
...t/home/egav/ega-v-t/90002877920021022295301TV.DAT:  202.06 kB   54.47
kB/s  
...t/home/egav/ega-v-t/90002877920021023296301TV.DAT:   51.75 kB   26.66
kB/s 

Doing it with sed, I need as result only the complete string between
"/900*.DAT:" without the / and :

I tried everything within my poor SED knowledge, but couldn't get it.

I really yould appreciate any help.

CU,
Roland

hi Roland,
Would this work??

sed -n 's/.*\/\([^\/]*\):.*/\1/p'

This is GNU sed 4.0 -- ssed will still be maintained because of its
different (faster but not internationalized) regex matcher, but apart from
Perl regular expressions it will have the same feature set as GNU sed 4.0

super-sed has been made a branch of the sed project.

This is for GNU sed

> http://queen.rett.polimi.it/~paolob/seders/ssed

This is for super-sed.

As I said, GNU sed and super-sed are still separate programs, but the
differences are a lot less important than they used to be.

[...snipped...]

This works in GNU sed v3.02:

`datafile' contains your records.

[amar@aashram /amar] sed -n 's/.*\/\(.*\)\:.*/\1/p' datafile
>/tmp/data.parsed && mv /tmp/data.parsed ./datafile

--amarendra

Subject: how to superimpose several lines
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I have a file in which the first character of every line is reserved for
printing instruction: "1" for form feed, and "+" for carriage return, " "
for line feed.

I want to re-format the file so that there will be no "+" lines, i.e., I
need to superimpose these "+" lines.

For example:


 All
+    these lines
+                are to be printed
+                                  on the same line.
+                                                      Skip 3 spaces.
 This is the second line printed.



I want the above lines to become:

 All these lines are to be printed on the same line.   Skip 3 spaces.
 This is the second line printed.

Note: the position of the first non-blank character on the "+" line will
only come after the position of the last non-blank character of the line
directly above, so no need to worry about overlapping. But can't simply join
them by substituting a blank in between these lines because all characters
need to remain at their original positions.

Can I get a one-liner sed? Thanks.

Joe

Subject: off topic: GNU sort, locale, and high ASCII characters
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

This question is off-topic for sed, but I think the issue of
internationalization and character sets is close enough to warrant my
posting this question to this mailing list:

I use GNU sort v2.0, compiled for MS-DOS/Windows.

I need to sort in a way that incorporates foreign-language diacritical
characters, which are present in the Extended ASCII characters from
0x80 to 0xA5 (using the IBM/OEM character set for "high ascii"
values). In other words, I want sort to treat the accented e ( =
&eacute; = 0x82 = 130dec) in the same order as lower-case e, and so
forth for the other foreign-language characters in the IBM/OEM
character set.

Right now, in the set

   beza
   bza
   biza

the accented e sorts after the i, and in fact sorts after "bzza",
which is to be expected, since  (0x82) comes after z (0x7A) in the
ASCII table. I believe that my question involves somehow the LOCALE
setting and the way that the C compiler was set when "sort" was
compiled for DOS/Windows, but I don't know enough to really answer the
question, which is (again):

How do I get GNU sort for DOS to put accented foreign characters in
their proper sequence? Are there environment variables I need to set?
Are the standard compilations at Simtel and DJGPP not sufficient? What
else do I need to do to get the sequencing in order? (My operating
system is Win98/COMMAND/4DOS, and Win2000/CMD/4NT; I use both.)

E-mail replies welcome.

hi Hassan,

Is "record" a line?

if ( record == line ) {
    sed -n '6~1s/file_regxp/my_regxp/p'
    or
    sed '6,$s/file_regxp/my_regxp/'
} if( record == 1char) {
   sed 's/^\(.\{6\}\)\(.*\)/\1\
    \2/;P;s/^.*\n//;s/file_regex/my_regex/' txt | sed 'N;s/\n//' 
} else {
    Can U tell us what is record?
}

If you don't want to use two seds, you need to use the hold
space.

sed 'h;s,^\(.\{6\}\)\(.*\),\2,;s/file_regex/my_regex/;G;s/\([^\n]*\)\n\(.\{6\}\).*/\2\1/'

Note: The above line is starts with "sed" and ends with "/'"
regards,
Praveen

You can use the sub-expression operator \(...\) to get a copy of
the regular expression expansion from the left-hand side
of an s command available via \d ;

6,$s/file_\(regxp\)/my_\1/g

If record #6 is the same as line #6, you do this:
 
     sed "7,$ s/file_regxp/my_regxp/" file
 
7,$ is a range expression, which means it affects lines 7 up to (and including) the last line of the file.
 
Lines 1-6 will be printed unchanged.

well - here you are *not* using accented characters
but sequences of characters with prepended accent, right?
i expect you will have to change your data (with sed :-)
eg "s/'e//g" - and then try the sorting again.

then again, you may be lucky with locales":

  export LANG=fr_FR

good luck!

looking at "last" logs?

anyway - you can convert those strings
into "seconds since epoch time", then
substract the number of one week ago
then extract the positive numbers,
and turn them back into date strings.
looks like a job for perl to me.  or
for pink rabbits folding potatoes.. ;-)

No way you can get a one-liner in sed. Not even ssed. While your 
request is maybe do-able in sed or ssed, it would be way too 
difficult, unless your goal is just to show that it IS doable. I 
would only write it in awk or perl. Here is a solution in awk to do 
what you ask:

   # awk script to superimpose lines marked by + and
   # leading spaces. "line" is always 1 line behind.
   {
     if ( $0 !~ /^\+/ && NR != 1) {
        print line
        line = $0
        dist = length(line)
     } else {
       tail = substr($0, dist+1)
       line = line tail
       prev = $0
       dist = length(prev)
     }
   }
   END { print line }
   #---end of awk script---

Could one use Greg Ubben's tab expansion technique here 
to duplicate the existing text as a string of spaces of 
the same length and then use that to match and remove the 
excess leading spaces?

Way too difficult!?
You must be joking. Invoke sed in quiet mode and this little
script works fine:
sed -n -f test.sed input.txt
where test.sed is:
:top
N   # always have two lines in pattern space
s/\n+[ ]*\(.*\)/ \1/ # if plus line is 2nd line then delete plus and spaces
ttop                 # cycle till no more plus lines seen
P                    # print first line in pattern space
D                    # delete first line

Subject: using sed to sort 8-bit ASCII text (long)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Status:   

        SORTING TEXT WITH DIACRITICAL (8-bit ASCII) CHARACTERS
          or: How to write your own collating sequences

                            by Eric Pement
                             25 Oct. 2002

   Recently, I tried to solve the problem of how to sort lines with
diacritical characters (characters using the acute or grave accent,
tilde, circumflex, diaeresis or umlaut, etc.). I use a Windows
2000/CMD environment, and the accented symbols are on the "high" end
of the ASCII table -- generally speaking, in the region from 0x80 to
0xA7. (In this notation, "0x82" represents 82 in hexadecimal, which 
is
also 202 in octal, and 130 in decimal.)

   The problem is, the standard GNU 'sort' utility sorts characters 
in
strict ASCII sequence. I wanted to see this:

      baza
      beza     # accented 'e'
      biza
      boza

where the 'e' on line #2 is a single character with acute accent (in
HTML, &eacute;). However, the ASCII value of this character is 
greater
than 'z', because all accented symbols have the 8th bit set in the
IBM/OEM character set. Therefore, my sort was coming out like this:

      baza
      biza
      boza
      beza     # accented 'e'

which was not what I wanted. I tried setting the environment variable
LC_COLLATE, which was supposed to configure the local "collating
sequence" for the GNU sort utility, but changing this value had no
effect. Accented characters still sort after unaccented characters.
There was nothing I could do to change that ... or so I thought.

   Sed to the rescue!

   It was a tip from Sven Guckes that started me on the right track 
to
solving this problem. I posted my question on the sed-users mailing
list, and Sven's mail client apparently displayed my accented "e" as
two separate characters, e' (e, apostrophe). The letter "e" with a
grave accent was displayed as e`. He helpfully tried to explain that
I could use sed to convert the two-character string back to a
single-byte character, by using the sed substitution command.

   I didn't think much of it at the time, but while trying to solve
the problem, I discovered that GNU sort has a -d switch, which 
ignores
embedded punctuation marks while sorting. This led to the solution.

THE SOLUTION:

   I can use one sed script to change the input file, altering all
high-bit characters to 3-character equivalents. I change (acute-e) to
(e+'), (grave-e) to (e+`), (cedilla-c) to (c+,), and so forth.

   Then I use sort -d to sort the new file in dictionary order. The -
d
switch causes 'sort' to ignore any punctuation marks or symbols when
sorting the line.

   Finally, I use another sed script to change the 3-character 
symbols
back into the form I started with, converting (e+') to (acute-e),
(e+`) back to (grave-e), (c+,) back to (cedilla-c), etc.

   The first script should look like this:

     # filename: accent_to_3.sed
     #
     # GNU sed script changes IBM/OEM accented alphabetical 
characters
     # to three-character equivalents. Note that this method relies 
on
     # the plus sign (+) not being used in the input file! GNU sed or
     # ssed will recognize \xHH as hex values.
     #
     s/\x80/C+,/g;     # cap C cedilla
     s/\x81/u+e/g;     # German umlaut u = 'ue' in English
     s/\x82/e+'/g;     # e acute
     s/\x83/a+^/g;     #
     s/\x84/a+:/g;     # a diaeresis
     s/\x85/a+`/g;     #
     s/\x86/a+@/g;     # a with ring above
     s/\x87/c+,/g;     # c cedilla
     s/\x88/e+^/g;     #
     s/\x89/e+:/g;     # e diaeresis
     s/\x8A/e+`/g;     #
     s/\x8B/i+:/g;     #
     s/\x8C/i+^/g;     #
     s/\x8D/i+`/g;     #
     s/\x8E/A+:/g;     # A diaresis
     s/\x8F/A+@/g;     # A with ring above
     s/\x90/E+'/g;     #
     s/\x91/a+e/g;     # ligature ae
     s/\x92/A+E/g;     # ligature AE
     s/\x93/o+^/g;     #
     s/\x94/o+e/g;     # German umlaut o = 'oe' in English
     s/\x95/o+`/g;     #
     s/\x96/u+^/g;     #
     s/\x97/u+`/g;     #
     s/\x98/y+:/g;     #
     s/\x99/O+e/g;     # German umlaut O = 'Oe' in English
     s/\x9A/U+e/g;     # German umlaut U = 'Ue' in English
     #
     # Break - nonalphabetic symbols between 0x9B and 0x9F
     #
     s/\xA0/a+'/g;     #
     s/\xA1/i+'/g;     #
     s/\xA2/o+'/g;     #
     s/\xA3/u+'/g;     #
     s/\xA4/n+~/g;     #
     s/\xA5/N+~/g;     #

     #
     s/\xE1/s+s/g;     # (Gk. beta) German eszet = "ss" in English
     #---end of script---

And the second script should look like this:

     # filename: 3_to_accent.sed
     #
     # GNU sed script changes 3-character strings to one-character
     # 8-bit symbols in the IBM/OEM character set. Note that we put
     # the '+' within [square brackets] so it will represent a plus
     # sign, regardless of whether the sed switches -r or -R are used
     # or not. Obviously, the plus sign in the input file must be a
     # reserved character, used only for 3-to-one character mapping.
     #
     s/C[+],/\x80/g;     # cap C cedilla
     s/u[+]e/\x81/g;     # 'u+e' maps to German umlaut u

     s/U[+]e/\x9A/g;     # 'U+e' maps to German umlaut U
     #
     # Break - nonalphabetic symbols between 0x9B and 0x9F
     #
     s/a[+]'/\xA0/g;     #
     s/i[+]'/\xA1/g;     #
     s/o[+]'/\xA2/g;     #

     s/o[+]-/\xA7/g;     #
     #
     s/s[+]s/\xE1/g;     # "s+s" is mapped to German eszet ( = Greek 
beta!)
     #---end of script---


   Finally, the solution script or batch file to run everything is
below. It uses GNU sed, ssed, HHsed, or any version of sed which has
support for \xHH hexadecimal notation.

       sed -f accent_to_3.sed input.file >temp.one
       sort -d temp.one >temp.two
       sed -f 3_to_accent.sed temp.two >output.file
       erase temp.one temp.two
       echo Sorted input file is now in 'output.file'

   This took several hours to work on, but it solves a particular
web-related sorting problem that I have. Hope it helps someone else.

FURTHER REFLECTIONS:

   The astute sed-user will recognize that this system allows them to
write their own collating sequences. For example, I wanted the German
umlauted-u (0x81) to be collated as "ue", so it appears as 'u+e' in
the first sed script. If you want 0x81 to be collated as "zork", just
map it to "z+o+r+k" in the first sed script, and use an inverse
mapping in the second sed script.

   As long as you make sure that mappings do not clash or overwrite
one another, this method enables you to write your own collating
sequences, giving you even more power than LC_COLLATE would give.

   It also is worth mentioning that this same principle would work on
HTML character entities. And to be absolutely honest, this is how I
started on this project in the first place. I have a database where
certain fields contain HTML character entities, like this (showing
only the key field, which consists of personal names):

     Marin, Louis
     B&eacute;za, Theodore
     G&uuml;ttgemanns, Erhardt
     Backus, Irena
     G&eacute;rard, Fran&ccedil;ois C.
     Hadidian, Dikran

   I knew that I could easily use sed to convert the database from
HTML character entities to IBM 8-bit characters, legible as normal
text. But then how could I use the "sort" utility to sort these names
once they were in 8-bit ASCII? Sort doesn't really understand the
collating sequence of the accented characters above 7F hex.

   So, this little exercise was really a bit more involved than I let
on at first. I kept it simple, just asking how to persuade 'sort' to
recognize accented symbols. But my real motivation is the one I have
presented here.

   And for the sed-users mailing list, now you know why I always used
the string 'B(acute-e)za' in my sorting examples. It was a short 
word,
and I wanted the accented form of "Beza" to come after "Benz" and
before "Bishop" when the database is sorted. That's it!

   If you need further explanation or notice something that needs
adjustment, please write me. Thanks!

   I have a tendency to delete "extraneous" text when quoting my 
messages, and so maybe I deleted too much or maybe you didn't read 
the original posting closely enough.

   The original poster said that a script like yours wouldn't work 
because it doesn't preserve extra spaces when superimposing the 
lines. For example, the 2-line input file:

>THIS IS LINE ONE
>+                      THIS IS LINE TWO

should be converted to:

>THIS IS LINE ONE      THIS IS LINE TWO

which has 6 spaces between "ONE" and "THIS". The regular expression 
in your script will eat up all the whitespace after the plus sign(+) 
and replace it with a single space. This was not what the original 
poster wanted to do. The request was to literally superimpose line 1 
over line 2.. To use another example:

>AAA BBB CCC
>+     DDD EEE FFF

should result in

>AAA BBB CCCEE FFF

if the script is functioning as requested. I do think the request is 
"do-able" in sed. I just don't have the patience to work it out, but 
I can tell you in advance it's no 3- or 4-line solution (unless your 
lines are very long!!).  Maybe if your name were Greg Ubben, you 
might be able to come up with a brief solution, but it doesn't strike 
me as soluble in less then 10 lines.

Kind regards,

Eric Pement

No, I mean single-byte characters. I don't know how my characters 
appeared to you, but to get the e-acute, I held down the ALT key and 
pressed 1-3-0 on the numeric keypad, and then released the ALT key. 
That method generates a single character with a decimal value of 130 
(which is 82 in hex or 202 in octal).

  The "export" command isn't used in DOS. But when I tried setting 
LANG="fr_FR" as an environment variable, it didn't seem to do 
anything. I will continue looking and let you know what I find.

Kind regards,

Subject: Joining lines
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I am trying to join together lines of a paragraph in a file. Let us say for
example that I have:
Mary had a little lamb,
She fed it TNT,
She threw it on the fire one day,
And now its fricassee.

And what I would like to get out is:
Mary had a little lamb, She fed it TNT, She threw it on the fire one day, And now its fricassee.

I have a substitution rule as follows:
s/\(.\)\n\(.\)/\1 \2/

which I thought would match any-char/line-end/any-char, and substitute all
line-end with " ". But it doesn't. In fact a diff on the input and
output reveals nothing is changed. So wth is going on, please?

$ sed -V
GNU sed version 3.02

$ UNAME
CYGWIN_98-4.10


TIA.

   I'm a Christian minister currently in seminary, and if I
thought that sed had anything to do with 'wth', I wouldn't
be using it! I've also had my share of frustration with
debugging sed scripts, and have sometimes even wondered if
sed might not be a demonic distraction to take me away from
greater things. (smile) However, to answer your question:

   Sed is a line-oriented editor. It reads one line at a time,
and applies all the script to that line (and the script may
address that line, may skip it, may delete it, or whatnot).

   Thus, the \n in your s/ubsti/tution/ will never match,
simply because you don't have two lines in the pattern space.
You have to use N, or H and [gG], to get 2 lines in the
pattern space.

   The sed FAQ explains why your script isn't working at
question 5.10 ("Why can't I match or delete a newline using
the \n escape sequence? Why can't I match 2 or more lines
using \n?").

   To reformat paragraphs like you want, you could try

       fmt -w 9999 yourfile

which is a dedicated paragraph reformatting utility
included with most types of *nix. You could also try this
perl script on my web space, which offers some additional
features:

http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/perl/reform.pl.txt

   Thanks. Hope this helps!

That's not something sed could do particul;arly efficiently, though it can
do it with enough effort.

But firstly, what format is the text in, ie how are paragraphs delimited
and how can you put colour in to this document?

insert color codes before (and after) the word.

of course the complete test has to be read for this
before you can decide which the most frequent word is.

but i'd find it quite boring to see that words
like "and be or to" are the most frequent ones.

your problem probably is much more specific.
but before i waste any time trying to guess it
you should probably come up with a more
elaborate description of your problem..

Al Aab asked:

> how to colorise the most frequent word
> or two in each paragraph

Do you mean, For each paragraph, colorize the two
words which appear most frequently throughout the
document?

or, For each paragraph, colorize the two
words which appear most frequently in that
paragraph?

Actually, this is easily do-able. The real trick
is, Do you want to display the colorized words just
on the console (via "more < yourfile") using ANSI
color sequences, or do you want to display the
colorized words within an editor like emacs, vim,
multi-edit, vedit or some other editor?

Tip: When you get the two most frequent words,
write the results to the ini file (.emacs, vimrc,
etc.) and copy the input file to special filetype,
where emacs, vim, multi-edit, vedit are set to give
syntax highlighting and color to that new filetype.

What's your favorite text editor, Al?  Does it
support syntax colors, which can be configured
in an .INI file?

Subject: delete lines
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi,
I need some help for deleting lines and adding text.
In my company we have a file (format given below) where
user details are recorded. Now the problem is that if those people who cannot
use editors in *nix try to maniplulate that files things might go wrong.
So, I am using a script for that.

File Format : -

[payal - Information ] # username is unique
Name = payal
Address = some address
Pager No. = xxxxxxx
Special Directory = /backup/payal/now

1. There are many entries like this, with exactly 5 lines in all for each
user. Now if I want to delete user payal's deltails from that file
(records.log), how can I do it thru' a script. I mean when I run that
script it should ask for username and delete her/his 5 lines from that
file.

2. Also I made a script for adding users. I can add the first 4 fields
properly using echo and ">>". But when I try to add the Special
Directory entry I cannot do that,
echo "Special Directory = /backup/$name/now/" >> records.log
results in,
Special Directory = /backup//now/
in records.log
How to improve on this part?

Thanks a lot for the help and bye.

        SORTING TEXT WITH DIACRITICAL (8-bit ASCII) CHARACTERS
          or: How to write your own collating sequences

                            by Eric Pement
                             25 Oct. 2002

   Recently, I tried to solve the problem of how to sort lines with
diacritical characters (characters using the acute or grave accent,
tilde, circumflex, diaeresis or umlaut, etc.). I use a Windows
2000/CMD environment, and the accented symbols are on the "high" end
of the ASCII table -- generally speaking, in the region from 0x80 to
0xA7. (In this notation, "0x82" represents 82 in hexadecimal, which 
is
also 202 in octal, and 130 in decimal.)

   The problem is, the standard GNU 'sort' utility sorts characters 
in
strict ASCII sequence. I wanted to see this:

      baza
      beza     # accented 'e'
      biza
      boza

where the 'e' on line #2 is a single character with acute accent (in
HTML, &eacute;). However, the ASCII value of this character is 
greater
than 'z', because all accented symbols have the 8th bit set in the
IBM/OEM character set. Therefore, my sort was coming out like this:

      baza
      biza
      boza
      beza     # accented 'e'

which was not what I wanted. I tried setting the environment variable
LC_COLLATE, which was supposed to configure the local "collating
sequence" for the GNU sort utility, but changing this value had no
effect. Accented characters still sort after unaccented characters.
There was nothing I could do to change that ... or so I thought.

   Sed to the rescue!

   It was a tip from Sven Guckes that started me on the right track 
to
solving this problem. I posted my question on the sed-users mailing
list, and Sven's mail client apparently displayed my accented "e" as
two separate characters, e' (e, apostrophe). The letter "e" with a
grave accent was displayed as e`. He helpfully tried to explain that
I could use sed to convert the two-character string back to a
single-byte character, by using the sed substitution command.

   I didn't think much of it at the time, but while trying to solve
the problem, I discovered that GNU sort has a -d switch, which 
ignores
embedded punctuation marks while sorting. This led to the solution.

THE SOLUTION:

   I can use one sed script to change the input file, altering all
high-bit characters to 3-character equivalents. I change (acute-e) to
(e+'), (grave-e) to (e+`), (cedilla-c) to (c+,), and so forth.

   Then I use sort -d to sort the new file in dictionary order. The -
d
switch causes 'sort' to ignore any punctuation marks or symbols when
sorting the line.

   Finally, I use another sed script to change the 3-character 
symbols
back into the form I started with, converting (e+') to (acute-e),
(e+`) back to (grave-e), (c+,) back to (cedilla-c), etc.

   The first script should look like this:

     # filename: accent_to_3.sed
     #
     # GNU sed script changes IBM/OEM accented alphabetical 
characters
     # to three-character equivalents. Note that this method relies 
on
     # the plus sign (+) not being used in the input file! GNU sed or
     # ssed will recognize \xHH as hex values.
     #
     s/\x80/C+,/g;     # cap C cedilla
     s/\x81/u+e/g;     # German umlaut u = 'ue' in English
     s/\x82/e+'/g;     # e acute
     s/\x83/a+^/g;     #
     s/\x84/a+:/g;     # a diaeresis
     s/\x85/a+`/g;     #
     s/\x86/a+@/g;     # a with ring above
     s/\x87/c+,/g;     # c cedilla
     s/\x88/e+^/g;     #
     s/\x89/e+:/g;     # e diaeresis
     s/\x8A/e+`/g;     #
     s/\x8B/i+:/g;     #
     s/\x8C/i+^/g;     #
     s/\x8D/i+`/g;     #
     s/\x8E/A+:/g;     # A diaresis
     s/\x8F/A+@/g;     # A with ring above
     s/\x90/E+'/g;     #
     s/\x91/a+e/g;     # ligature ae
     s/\x92/A+E/g;     # ligature AE
     s/\x93/o+^/g;     #
     s/\x94/o+e/g;     # German umlaut o = 'oe' in English
     s/\x95/o+`/g;     #
     s/\x96/u+^/g;     #
     s/\x97/u+`/g;     #
     s/\x98/y+:/g;     #
     s/\x99/O+e/g;     # German umlaut O = 'Oe' in English
     s/\x9A/U+e/g;     # German umlaut U = 'Ue' in English
     #
     # Break - nonalphabetic symbols between 0x9B and 0x9F
     #
     s/\xA0/a+'/g;     #
     s/\xA1/i+'/g;     #
     s/\xA2/o+'/g;     #
     s/\xA3/u+'/g;     #
     s/\xA4/n+~/g;     #

     #
     s/\xE1/s+s/g;     # (Gk. beta) German eszet = "ss" in English
     #---end of script---

And the second script should look like this:

     # filename: 3_to_accent.sed
     #
     # GNU sed script changes 3-character strings to one-character
     # 8-bit symbols in the IBM/OEM character set. Note that we put
     # the '+' within [square brackets] so it will represent a plus
     # sign, regardless of whether the sed switches -r or -R are used
     # or not. Obviously, the plus sign in the input file must be a
     # reserved character, used only for 3-to-one character mapping.
     #
     s/C[+],/\x80/g;     # cap C cedilla
     s/u[+]e/\x81/g;     # 'u+e' maps to German umlaut u

     #---end of script---


   Finally, the solution script or batch file to run everything is
below. It uses GNU sed, ssed, HHsed, or any version of sed which has
support for \xHH hexadecimal notation.

       sed -f accent_to_3.sed input.file >temp.one
       sort -d temp.one >temp.two
       sed -f 3_to_accent.sed temp.two >output.file
       erase temp.one temp.two
       echo Sorted input file is now in 'output.file'

   This took several hours to work on, but it solves a particular
web-related sorting problem that I have. Hope it helps someone else.

FURTHER REFLECTIONS:

   The astute sed-user will recognize that this system allows them to
write their own collating sequences. For example, I wanted the German
umlauted-u (0x81) to be collated as "ue", so it appears as 'u+e' in
the first sed script. If you want 0x81 to be collated as "zork", just
map it to "z+o+r+k" in the first sed script, and use an inverse
mapping in the second sed script.

   As long as you make sure that mappings do not clash or overwrite
one another, this method enables you to write your own collating
sequences, giving you even more power than LC_COLLATE would give.

   It also is worth mentioning that this same principle would work on
HTML character entities. And to be absolutely honest, this is how I
started on this project in the first place. I have a database where
certain fields contain HTML character entities, like this (showing
only the key field, which consists of personal names):

     Marin, Louis
     B&eacute;za, Theodore
     G&uuml;ttgemanns, Erhardt
     Backus, Irena
     G&eacute;rard, Fran&ccedil;ois C.
     Hadidian, Dikran

   I knew that I could easily use sed to convert the database from
HTML character entities to IBM 8-bit characters, legible as normal
text. But then how could I use the "sort" utility to sort these names
once they were in 8-bit ASCII? Sort doesn't really understand the
collating sequence of the accented characters above 7F hex.

   So, this little exercise was really a bit more involved than I let
on at first. I kept it simple, just asking how to persuade 'sort' to
recognize accented symbols. But my real motivation is the one I have
presented here.

   And for the sed-users mailing list, now you know why I always used
the string 'B(acute-e)za' in my sorting examples. It was a short 
word,
and I wanted the accented form of "Beza" to come after "Benz" and
before "Bishop" when the database is sorted. That's it!

   If you need further explanation or notice something that needs
adjustment, please write me. Thanks!

[ ... rest deleted ... ]

   I have re-thought the script I used and I now think that a
safer solution is to use a VERY unlikely marker, such as a control
character in the file (e.g., 0x1C, which is Ctrl-\).  Such a
character has a far less chance of being in a text file, when
a symbol like + might easily be used for multiple reasons, such
as auto-increment or for decoration.

   I believe the control codes will also be skipped with the
-d switch in GNU sort, and this is probably a safer route.

Thanks for reminding me of this. I'm working every day on

The snippet you've sent is plain text: there is no colour information.

What we need is the following:

A sample of the original text

Maybe a sample of the final test with colour information. Why not show us
an example with html-esque colour tags like

<blue>this text is blue<green>and this bit is green

etc...

sneaky moi
no
no color info
why
years ago
when i invented an email list called
surprise ..
seders

2 go w fancy seders
i also invented a fancy sig

lo + behold
all hell broke loose

why

many browsers do not take kindly to extended ascii
or so it seems
i still use good ol msdos.

my sig had 8bit extended ascii chars.
had to change that once-alluting sig
to a more mundane under-127-chars sig


so this time
(who sed u cant teach an old seder nauveou trics ?)
i refrained & desisted.

any how

just to satisfy thou
plz
read the soon my next post
specs/test file

thanks fro your esteemed attention/response
if i have not made sense
blame it on my timely senility
& keep trying
moi

Subject: color your paras + sed wish list
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

			hi seders

days after preparing the following specs/testfile

weeks after inventing a secondordersedscript
	a scriipt who auomatically/dynimically generates sedscripts

& after trying the daunting dream of rewriting sed15.
(managed to
 update its/my old debugger,
 remove the infinite loop guard
 multiply its buffers
 print trace info
)

	i mangaed to invent a firstordersedscipt
	 using extant msdos seds
	  (me a hardcore dosman).

still i think sed (& others)
can benefit from :

	late binding
	the execute
	self modification
	close file
	removeing the intermediate semi-compilation
	append to a pre-sed-script existing file
	'r' command that puts lines in the pattern space
	'=' command that puts linenumber in the pattern space
	extensive negative logic
		e.g.   P-  G- H-
	negative address in  s///  a la  //!
	/.../s/\1/.../
		match a bunch of patterns, tag them, select some
		baxkrefs to some/all those tags, rescan/resubstitute line
	shell to OS
		(guess ssed took care of the last 2 wish items)
	merge 2 strings/files
	split files into auto-numbered files
	sed script that takes parameters

most of the above shoud be easy extentions to add
without breaking the backward compatiblity or ths sed spirit.

i made some aborted forays in M4 & mumps (invented 1992)
not to mention APL, snobol, ...
from APL we may borrow the merge-2-arrays
------------------------------------------
		color your paras II

thanks to the  gentle  seders respondents.
this is both a restatement of the
		color your paras
challenge
and a test file

INPUT to the color your paras sed script:
any everyday text file
paragraphs, hereafter called paras
shall be distinguished with
on or more empty lines

evey empty line or nonemptyline
could end in trailing blanks or tabs

	*		*		*


OUTPUT shall be viewed on
1- the www with a standard internet browser
or
2- on a computer monitor using both
		ansi.sys
	&	the type command

do not worry about :-
		viewing with editors)
		noise words (the, or, you, me, i, ...)
		distinguishing very short frases/words (1 or 2 chars)
		the freqest frase/s in the whole input file.
pitfall		CaSe SenSe.
pitfall		embedded colorizing
WHAT TO ACCOMPLISH
colorize
or
visually distinguish, in any reasonable 		manners
the frequest frase/s
one, two, or three frases.
WHAT WHAT TO ACCOMPLISH

RED:  the frequest (most frequently occuring, within A para) frase
shall have ALL its occurences within its own para), say, colored RED
GREEN:the next frequest (most frequently occuring, within 1 para) frase
shall have ALL its occurences within its own para), say, colored GREEN.
BLUE: the next frequest (most frequently occuring, within 1 para) frase
shall have ALL its occurences within its own para), say, colored GREEN.



EXTRA CREDITS:
1:	if you distinguish/colorize the  *longest*  freqest frase/s,
2:	if you sed it in one step
		(first-order sed, no autogenerated scripts).
3:	if you sed it replacing every above occurence of      'para'
					with                 'chapter'
3:	if you sed it in an MSDOS sed, as well
				sedable ?!

Subject: Re: deleting lines between two lines
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

There is more than one way to to do this.
I like to use the s command with the t command. The t branch only happens if
the previous substitution has been successful.
So,
s/### Begin ###//
tloop
b
:loop 
n
s/### End ###//
t
bloop
Might do what you want. I haven't tested this and I forget if # needs to be
escaped.
Call this script with:
sed -f scriptabove filename

Why sed?

    (cat a; echo 'added line') > a.new

But if you want to do it in sed

    sed -e '$a\' -e 'added line' a > a.new

If you want to overwrite the old file you need ssed or GNU sed 4.x:

    sed -i -e '$a\' -e 'added line' a

But then why not

    echo 'added line' >> a.new

Oops!  I owe you an apology!  I didn't read the original posting
closely enough.  To beat this into my head (you learn more when
you fail than when you succeed) I created the general overstrike
problem:

The input file consists of a series of records with the first 
character of each record being a printer control character. In
the case of an overstrike printer control character, a "+",
the previous line is overstruck with all nonblank characters 
from the current line maintaining all column positions and 
maintaining the previous line's printer control character.
There is no limit on the number of overstrike records.

The following input file, input.txt:

 111
+ 222
  333
+444
 555
+666
 7 7 7 
+ 8 8 8
 999
+888
+777
+666
 1  1  1
+ 22 22 22
+  3  3  3
-222
+  333

should produce the result:

 1222
 4443
 666
 787878
 666
 123123123
-22333

The following sed command line:

sed -f overstrk.sed 

where overstrk.sed is:

:top
N               # always have two lines in pattern space
/\n+/{          # was second line an overstrike line?
   s/\n+/\n /   # yes, delete plus sign
   s/^/\n/      # create merge buffer at start of pattern space
   :merge
   s/^\(.*\)\n.\(.*\n\)\([^ ]\)\(.*\)$/\1\3\n\2\4/;tmerge #overstrike
   s/^\(.*\)\n\(.\)\(.*\n\) \(.*\)$/\1\2\n\3\4/;tmerge    #do not
   s/\n//g      # combine merged buffer with remaining line 1 or 2
   btop
}
P                     # print line
D                     # delete first line, repeat till done


does the job.  Many thanks to aurelio for his sed debugger!

Hi
I want to use SED from a korn script to remove the first part of each line in a file.  The section to be removed has an " as a delimiter.
 
Modify the following
 
(line 1) "remove words in quotes at the start of each line" leaving the rest of the line 
(line 2) "remove words in quotes at the start of each line" leaving the rest of the line
  etc
 
so the end result is
 
(line 1)  leaving the rest of the line
(line 2)  leaving the rest of the line
 
thanks
 
James McConnell

Well, you really are a beginner, aren't you, to sed and linux and bash and
all. That's ok. 
The script is how I originally posted it. This is a sed script, not a bash
script. 
You run this script from the command line using sed.

Task: replace only the first match of 'foo' with 'bar' in a file, leaving
all other matches alone. Must work on plain vanilla sed. Shortest sed
script will go into the sed FAQ, with credit (if desired). This should
be a one-liner.

I'm not an experienced sed-user but I'll try

    sed 's/^\([^"]*\)"[^"]*"\(.*\)/\1\2/' infile

sed "s/\".*\"//" file 
might do it.

Not sure if this is vanilla sed:

    sed '/foo/{s//bar/;:a;N;ba}'

22 chars, though

Hm. looks like I need to use 'n' with BSD sed, instead of 'N':

      sed '/foo/{s//bar/;:a;n;ba}'

Don, this is an excellent answer. However, to be fully portable to 
other versions, you need to use $! for the n and b commands. Here's 
why:

If "foo" is on the very last line:

  ssed v3.59 repeats the last line twice for (n;ba;), but
  only once for (N;ba;}

  GNU sed 3.02.80 handles both (n;ba;) and (N;ba;) the same,
  printing the last line one time each. (Paolo, are you aware
  of this?)

  sed15 and GNU sed 205 prints the last line once for (n;ba;),
  and deletes the last line for (N;ba;).

The most portable syntax is ($!n;$ba;) or ($!N;$!ba).

The other problem is that older versions of sed don't accept anything 
at all after labels or branch commands. For example, sed v1.03 
(distributed with Virtual Unix utils) requires a syntax like this:

   sed -e "/foo/{s//bar;:a;$!N;$!ba" -e "}" file

And so I think the most portable version would look like this:

   sed -e '/foo/{s//bar;:a' -e '$!N;$!ba' -e '}' file

But this is a great answer. Thanks!

   I haven't tested this script yet (don't have time), but if it 
works as you say it does, you have done a masterful job. 
Congratulations!

   I would like to see this script archived on the sed-users Grabbag 
or somewhere else. This is good work! Kudos!

Kind regards,

Subject: unix textproc one-liners
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi all,

On the one liners subject, have we ever compiled a list of sed
versions of the Unix textproc tools? I know there are a few
mentioned in the 1liners doc. I believe we've got: 

    head, tail, wc, tr, grep, tac, uniq, rev

Here's a (non-portable) few more.

    cat                   ->  sed :
    echo 'Hello, world!'  ->  sed 's/.*/Hello, world!/;q' <(yes)
    cut -c 10             ->  sed 's/\(.\)\{10\}.*/\1/'
    cut -d':' -f4         ->  sed 's/\(\([^:]*\):\)\{4\}.*/\2/'

Are there any others people have out there? Like ... sort? Other
variants of grep? An echo that works without the hack above?

Cheers,
    Don

1h;1!H;$!d;g;s/foo/bar/

Sadly this places the entire file into the hold space.  Consequently I think it's a poor solution, but nevertheless it's quite short.

I'm using the dreadful HP-UX sed, so I think I can be pretty sure that if it works on my sed it will work on any sed.  No embedded braces; no embedded labels; no escape characters; no functionality really!

Best wishes,
Stew

:			msdos batch file


:  using MS-DOS & ANSI.sys  to color bible verses, just the capital
letters,
:							some thereof
: input file: king james bible clarified 1999.

: Colorize the Capital initials in every verse.
: EXCEPRION:      do NOT colorize the first word of every BIBLE verse

: E.G:                                   5:6 And the  Lord
: do NOT color the A in And.  but color initial L in  Lord,  red.

: do NOT color And,  but color all                    JESUS  red

: Abraham is not red

nnsed -r "s~([^0-9.])([ ])([A-Z]+)~\1\2\x1b[31m\3\x1b[0m~g" %1

: nnsed is a DOS version of gnused 3.02
: my msdos box does not use 'more' to page ansi.sys products
:  more  occludes ansi.sys colors.  at least in my old experience.
: instead of more, my config.sys is equipped with a tiny clone
: of ansi.sys, called  warp, or warpf (warp fast).
: warp/f is so cute it supercedes both ansi.sys & more
: warp/f pages both input and output.... and shortens DOS' beep.
: to enable pageing: turn scrolllock   on.
: warp/f is at simtel/msdos

Doesn't work if we have "foo" on the first line and another "foo"
in the rest of file. At least with GNU sed version 3.02. 
But maybe I'm missing something.

If I run this using nasty HP-UX sed and I have "foo" on every line, sed replaces the first incidence of foo in the first TWO lines.  I suspect that this could be classified as an HP-UX sed bug.
:-(

i've put all this info on a doc, and upload to the SED site
  http://sed.sf.net/local/docs/emulating_unix.txt

there's also a link for it on the main page, under DOCUMENTATION
section.

let's update it!

a shorter uniq, from the 1liners (I think):

    uniq              sed N;/^\(.*\)\n\1$/!P;D

also in the 1liners:

    cat -s            sed /./,/^$/!d

wow! just like eric i'm VERY impressed with this script.
CONGRATULATIONS! i still don't believe it does what it does
in just 2 s/// lines. i'll still have to study it to
understand the technique.

Eric: Yes, it works :)

i have modified it a little because on my cygwin sed here
3.02, \n can't be directly addressed on s//here/

so, we have to store \n on a buffer and reference it, like

   s/...\(\n\).../...\1.../ 

so 's/\n+/\n /' was changed to 's/\(\n\)+/\1 /' and the two
big s/// were renumbered the backreferences to insert the \n

the dirty trick was on the 's/^/\n/' which has changed to
'H;s/.*//;x', to get the \n from the empty buffer when using H

another change was to add the ; before the comments, to
separate it from the sed commands.

here it is, the more portable version of genious overstrk.sed:

:top
N                 ;# always have two lines in pattern space
/\n+/{            ;# was second line an overstrike line?
  s/\(\n\)+/\1 /  ;# yes, delete plus sign
  H;s/.*//;x      ;# create merge buffer at start of pattern space
  :merge
  s/^\(.*\)\(\n\).\(.*\n\)\([^ ]\)\(.*\)$/\1\4\2\3\5/;tmerge ;#overstrk
  s/^\(.*\)\(\n\)\(.\)\(.*\n\) \(.*\)$/\1\3\2\4\5/;tmerge    ;#do not
  s/\n//g         ;# combine merged buffer with remaining line 1 or 2
  btop
}
P                 ;# print line
D                 ;# delete first line, repeat till done


> Many thanks to aurelio for his sed debugger!

the debugger is an unvaluable tool when sed scripts go as
mad as this one :)

ok, it's already on sed.sf.net.

ecbyahoo, if you want to write a text explaining how it
works, i can add to the script headers also.

Subject: insert an extra line - how?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

There is a textfile which shows every fifth line the
character " ~ " at the head of an empty line.

All I want to do is, insert an extra line with 41 spaces before this said
line.

Can anyone tell me please, how this must be solved?

sed is GNU sed version 3.02.

Well, I don't know a smooth way of putting in 41 blanks, but this works for
a few xxx's.
sed "s/~/xxx\n&/"

Don't have time to work on this right now. But, think about using the hold
space.
Put the entire pattern into the hold space.
Delete the non delimited part of the line in the pattern space.
Make the spaces change.
exchange the hold and pattern space.
delete the delimited part of the line.
exchange the hold and pattern space, then append the hold space to the
pattern space.
delete the embedded newline.
Print.
As they say in math, the proof is left as an exercise to the student.

One way (kludgy, but works):

#!/bin/sh
echo -n "Enter the name to delete: "
read name
sed '/^\['"$name"' - Information/ {
    N
    N
    N
    N
    d
}' <records.log >tmp$$
mv tmp$$ records.log

Looks like you didn't set the value for the variable "name" in your
script.

Subject: 'for' loops
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hey all,

                        for loops in sed
                        ----------------

This codelet comes from a script that needed to print two lines
at a known line offset after a regex. So why not find the
pattern, then use a 'for' loop to count down to the required
lines?

#!/usr/bin/sed -nf

/PAT/ {               # if (line =~ /PAT/) {
    s/.*/./           #     i = 1
    h
    : while           #     while (true) {
    x
    /^.\{3\}$/ {      #         if (i == 3) {
        x
        p             #             println()
        x
        b cont        #         }
    }
    /^.\{13\}$/ {     #         else if (i == 13) {
        x
        p             #             println()
        q             #             exit()
    }
    : cont            #         }
    s/$/./            #         i++                  
    h                           
    n                 #         readln()
    b while           #     }
}                     # }


The index counts in base 1 :( It would be possible to count in
different bases using a lookup table. I like the idea of counting
in base 256 (base ascii), for optimal space complexity at the bit
level.

Cheers,
    Don

   I didn't forget. But this doesn't match if /foo/ is on the first 
line. The REAL solution for GNU or ssed users is this:

      sed '0,/foo/s//bar'

   However, I was looking for a shortie that was fully portable. And 
because many non-GNU versions of sed have a hold space of about 4K 
(max), I want to avoid reading the entire file into the pattern space 
or the hold space.

Subject: BSD sed?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi.

There's lots of talk of GNU sed (of course), HHsed, sedmod, ssed
and super sed. Where does BSD sed fit into all this?

On my system BSD sed talks about itself (in the source) as being
"POSIX". It seems to be dumber than GNU sed, but it has
certainly been developed since 4.4BSD.

Thanks for telling me the sed version:

   gsed "0~5i\                                         " file

For those who must read this message with proportional fonts, there 
should be 41 spaces between the backslash and the 2nd double-quote 
mark. I use "double quotes" because I use DOS. If you use Unix, you 
probably should use 'single quotes'.

As you can see, this simply does the insertion before every 5th line. 
Use "cat -n file | gsed {script}" on a small sample file to see how 
it's performing. The -n will number the lines before sed sees them. 
If you'd rather match the " ~ " instead of every 5th line, then do 
this:

   gsed "/^ ~ $/i\   ...etc..." file

You may want to experiment with the M~N line sequence, since your 
imput file might better match 1~5, or 1~4 or something different, 
depending on how carefully you've described the problem.

Well, that's a cool script, but that's a whole lotta work. If it's a 
known number of lines after an offset, why not use a known number of 
'n' commnds?

    sed -n "/pat/{n;n;n;p;n;n;n;n;n;n;n;n;n;p;}" file

I may have miscounted the number of n's to use, but you get the idea. 
Another possibility, easier to read, is awk:

   awk "/pat/{num = NR}; NR==num+3; NR==num+13" file

Or am I misunderstanding the problem?

Yes. It is supposed to be, though. The idea is to exactly emulate
the semantics of a classical for loop. State must be maintained
in an index somehow. The 'for' loop has a proper 'continue' block,
and we already know about if-else functionality, and a good
implementation of integer ==.

I was just going to come up with an exact semantic mapping of
imperative control structures to sed, you know, for fun.

No, you're right.  But then some seds have

0,/foo/ s/foo/bar/

That serves exactly this purpose.

No, it is right.  You match from the first line to the first line after the
first that matches /foo/.  You need 0,/foo/ if supported by your sed (don't
think so :-)

Subject: Is SED limited by unreadable characters?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

The following task works great
sed -e :a -e '$!N;s/\nX/ /;ta' -e 'P;D' 

BUT only when I manually delete the first 2 unreadable
characters in the file.
  
The following scripting does not solve my problem:
 
tr -s "\377" "\015" < file.in > step.01
tr -s "\376" "\015" < step.01 > step.02

Is this a matter of novice inexperience or is there 
a SED or TR solution?

thanks

James

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

The \n says to insert a newline and the & says to insert what was matched in
the left hand side (LHS) of the expression.

's,//\(.*\)$,/*\1*/,'

though I guess things will depend on which sed you're using.

Subject: concatenating lines within a file
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Is there any way of concatenating lines within a file for example the 
first line will have the word 'count' in it and the next line will 
have the number counted. I want to concatenate the lines into one. 
The file will have multiple lines around this so I don't know when 
this will occur.

This might do it.

/count/{

s/\n/ /
}       

Run the commmand:
sed -f scriptabove file

Well, fix that first.
I don't know anything about sed vesions. I am using linux and version:
GNU sed version 3.02.80
If you can't match and insert newlines easily, you won't be happy with sed.
Post your script.

How does one match \\ and convert it to \ ?
For example,
BlahBlah\\nBlahBlah
to become 
BlahBlah\nBlahBlah

What about:

s/\\\\/\\/g

In your example though, you have what looks like a newline character
(\n).  Is that what it really is?

Thanks for the response.

I originally tried this approach, but kept getting errors. I finally
got this working as you suggested, and so maybe I had dropped off a /
somewhere in there.

My problem was:

Label-HG-02-2345\n36%yo\nRoutine%PAP
is a directory name.

dir -1 | grep Lab 
gives
Label-FG-02-2345\\n36%yo\\nRoutine%PAP
grep adds a second \


Since the straightforward approach just wasn't working for me, I got
around this by using
ls -al | sed "s/.*Label-/Label-/"

That \n is supposed to be a newline character, eventually.
I am using folder names to annotate tif files using xv and some bash
scripts which, of course, rely heavily on sed. It is working. I'll find
out in the next few weeks if it is practical.  Using the visual schnauzer
as a GUI is not exactly what it was designed for.

Hi,

I want to ignore the case where C++ comment (//) is inside a C comment block
/**/ , ie

/*  sometext //whatever http://should also be ignored. somemoretext
somemoretext somemoretext somemoretext somemoretext
somemoretext */

I got how to ignore http:// , it works like this:
/http:\/\//b
s/\/\/\(.*\)$/\/\*\1\*\//g


How to ignore C comments in general ?
I tried like below, matches range from /* to */
It doesn't work:

/\/\*,\*\//b

In general, how to ignore contents of C-style comments ?

's,//\(.*\)$,/*\1*/,'

though I guess things will depend on which sed you're using.

http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/sed/
that one?  or is there some other home page of this?

Subject: escaping ']'
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I have a test data file:
. | * ? + ( ) { } [ ] ^ $ \

I want to escape these non-whitespace chars, so
\. \| \* \? \+ \( \) \{ \} \[ \] \^ \$ \\

This almost works:
sed 's;\([\\\.\[\|\*\?\+\(\)\{\}\^\$]\);\\\1;g' testfile

\. \| \* \? \+ \( \) \{ \} \[ ] \^ \$ \\

But as soon as I try and match that final remaining ']' the thing fails.

Can someone explain what I'm doing wrong?

Angus

jeez... what does it take to send a mail to the
address sed-users-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com ?
it's as easy as

  echo foo | mail sed-users-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com

do you think you can manage to copy&paste this into your shell?

Put the ] first inside the bracket expression:

sed 's;\([]\\\.\[\|\*\?\+\(\)\{\}\^\$]\);\\\1;g' testfile

- works for me:

$ echo '. | * ? + ( ) { } [ ] ^ $ \' | sed
's;\([]\\\.\[\|\*\?\+\(\)\{\}\^\$]\)
;\\\1;g'
\. \| \* \? \+ \( \) \{ \} \[ \] \^ \$ \\

$

Also this should work on any correct version of sed too:

$ echo '. | * ? + ( ) { } [ ] ^ $ \' | sed
's;\([]\.[|*?+(){}^$]\);\\\1;g'
\. \| \* \? \+ \( \) \{ \} \[ \] \^ \$ \\

$

Why?  Because meta-characters aren't treated as such inside a bracket
expression.  The only metacharacters inside a bracket expression in BREs
should be caret ^, but then only if it appears _first_, after the [, and
hyphen -, to show a range such as a-z, but then only if it _can_ show a
range, i.e., [a-z] is a range but [a-] isn't.

Why didn't I mention it before?  I forgot!

Hello, Hasan. I don't think you can do it with sed on its own, but you can do 
it using a shell script that makes use of sed.
Regards,
Angus

#! /bin/sh

if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
	echo "Usage: $0 data_file"
	exit 1
fi

if [ ! -r $1 ]; then
	echo "File $1 does not exist or is not readable"
	exit 1
fi

LOGFILEBASE=logfile_
# Uncomment this line if you want to remove any existing logfiles first
# rm -f ${LOGFILEBASE}*

for LINE in `cat $1 | sed '/^D[0-9]*S/!d'`; do
	NUMBER=`echo ${LINE} | sed 's/D\([0-9]*\)S.*/\1/'`
	FILE=${LOGFILEBASE}${NUMBER}
	echo ${LINE} >> ${FILE}
	echo ${LINE} sent to ${FILE}
done

Hi Hassan,

I was waiting for a long time to use one trick,
that I had in my mind.  I have got chance to try that now.

$ sed 's,^\(.\{3\}\).*,/^\1/ w \1,' txt | sed -n
'G;s/^\([^\n]*\)\n\(.*\1.*\)/\2/;h;$p' | sed -n -f - txt;

[Note: The above line starts with '$' and ends with ';']
I learnt from Paolo "build-a-sed-script-with-sed".  I will
remember this as long as I remember sed.
Paolo: Thanks

regards,
Praveen

This is a one-line command in ssed ("double-quotes" for
DOS, 'single-quotes' for Unix shells):

  ssed -R 's/D(\d+)S.*/echo & >>file_\1/e' infile

Tested on my system with bash, MingW32

Oh, very nifty. What does the -R option mean? And the e-command?

Anyway, normal sed isn't far behind either

sed '/^D[0-9]*S/!d; s/^D\([0-9]*\)S.*/echo & >> file_\1/' testfile

You could add '| sh' to the end too if you were feeling adventurous ;-)

Have a good w/e
Angus

  -R is a switch specific to ssed. It means to use Perl-style regular 
expressions. It should not be confused with -r, which means to use 
extended regular expressions. In any case, the -r or -R can be 
remembered by the word "regex".

   The /e option is borrowed from the perl s/ubsti/tution/ function, 
which also has an /e switch. It means to "evaluate" the replace 
portion of the expression. It is apparently evaluated on the 
operating system level or something near enough to it that the 
redirection arrows ">>" work in file creation and appending.

   Fortunately, you can also use the replacement parameters in Perl, 
so & and \1, \2, and so forth also work in the right side.

The shell level, surely!
As in the system(const char *string) call. It just executes its
arguments in a subshell, retaining the result.

As in popen(const char *cmd, const char *dir), actually.

Note that GNU sed 4.x can also do this as

  sed -r 's/D([0-9]+)S.*/echo & >> file_\1/e'

or


  sed 's/D\([0-9]\+\)S.*/echo & >> file_\1/e'

-R is the only ssed feature absent from GNU sed 4.x (at least for the time
being).

Subject: Bug in super-sed?
Reply-To: luc-groups@braziliantranslation.net
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

	I've never been able to use the -i (edit in place) option of super-sed
quite right. Instead of actually replacing the existing files, it creates
new files called:
	sedDOSSV3
	sedDOSSUW
	sedDOSSUZ
	sedDOSSUY
	sedDOSSV1
	sedDOSSV0
	sedDOSSUX
	... which contain the edited content. And it seems to ignore my ".bkp"
parameter. So it works, but not the way I want and the usage text lets me
expect. I wrote to Paolo Bonzini about it once, but could not provide any
more details. Talking about sed with the other (remarkably few) other sed
users I know, it seems that super-sed is not as popular as I think it
deserves to be among them. So maybe no one else has noticed it because they
don't use ssed, or if they do, they never used the -i option. Therefore,
I'd appreciate it if others could give it a try and tell me if it works in
their system.
	
	BTW: I'm running super-sed 3.59 on Windows 95. Which arises another
question: what is ssed's latest version? The official page
(http://queen.rett.polimi.it/~paolob/seders/ssed) advertises 3.58, but the
one I have claims to be 3.59?
	
	Thanks,

Define what you mean by blank columns. I'm not seeing blank 'fields' or
columns in your input file. If you are referring to blank characters in the
first three positions of a line, a quick way is to use vi.
Syntax
:%s/^   //
there are three spaces after the caret, & before the '/', & no spaces
between the second & third '/'

Subject: How to delete lines for one word the same as previous line?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Please could someone advise about the following?
I'd like to make a list of the first occurence for each surname from 
an html file with few thousand full names.
How do I get sed (Super-sed v3.59 on Windows) to look at the letters 
in the line between the " " and "</a>&nbsp;" on a line,  to compare 
the same part of the next line and if it's the same surname to delete 
that next line?
However there are also some other changes after this.
For example (can't stop it wrapping the text here):
to go from (these three lines)
<a name="i594"></a><a href="i594.html">Herman F. Barba</a>&nbsp;<i>25 
May 1937 -</i><br>
<a name="i694"></a><a href="i694.html">Mary Ann Barba</a>&nbsp;<i>3 
Nov 1957, NYC, NY, USA - ____</i><br>
<a name="i488"></a><a href="i488.html">John (Joe) 
Dun</a>&nbsp;<i></i><br>
to (these two lines)
<a href="ind0003.html#i594">Barba</a>,
<a href="ind0003.html#i488">Dun</a>,

idea:  use sed to a copy of put those name up front
and after sort:ing them use "uniq" to delete "duplicates":

sed -e 's/\(.* \)\([a-zA-Z]+\)\(<\/a>.*\)/\2 \1\2\3/'
    | sort | uniq -W 1 > result.txt

this assumes that the surname is the last "word"
before the final end anchor ("</a>") in the
line and that it consists of letter only;
that '+' suffices as a "one-or-more" operator
and the usual greediness of the ".*' parts.

check result.txt - does it look uniqe enough? ;-)

you can use sed to strip away the added
word in front, of course.  homework.

note: "uniq" uses the parameter "-W' here
which may be only available with GNU uniq.

The ! goes after the /pattern/, like this:

    sed '/^Postal Code:/!s/ubsti/tute/' file       # or

    sed '/^Postal Code:/!{ cmd1; cmd2; cmd3; }  file

Use "double quotes" instead of 'single quotes' if you run this
under MS-DOS or CMD.EXE.

[ ... ] 
> I want to get 1 field above and 1 field below,
> Postal Code:

Here are some things to think about:

   (GNU)  grep -B1 -A1 '^Postal Code:' file

will get you the lines you specify without any trouble; but
it will separate each block with 2 hyphens. The output from
the grep command may be usable for your situation.


    sed -n '/^Postal Code:/=' file

will print out the line number of each line that matches,
and you can then manipulate the output further. For example,

   sed -n '/^Postal/=' file | awk '{print $1-1 "," $1+1 "{cmd;}" }'

will turn

   5
   23

into

   4,6{cmd;}
   22,24{cmd;}

which you may recognize as a sed script that uses line numbers
as address ranges, so that "cmd;" or perhaps "cmd;cmd;cmd;"
is applied to each line that meets that range.

Hope this helps.

I use GNU sed version 3.02
Sorry, I do not get this at all, what is this s/ubsti/tute and what are
these cmd1, cmd2 etc. I am not very familar with sed.
When I give,
sed '/^Postal Code:/!s' file
I still get the original file with Postal Code lines included.
I have now modified the command to run as,
#sed -n '/^Postal Code:/!p' file
This one runs as expected. Is it ok?

Yes this works properly, thanks :-)
 
>    sed -n '/^Postal/=' file | awk '{print $1-1 "," $1+1 "{cmd;}" }'
it works, but again what is "cmd"?
What do I need to put here.

This cmd thing is confusing me.
Thanks a lot for the detailed mail and bye.

	I don't think that is possible at all with sed. You'll need a more
powerful language, like PHP, Perl, Python:

	find: (<a href="ind0000.html#i([0-9]+)">([A-Za-z]+)</a>)
	get \3
	if	(\3 in array @check)
		skip
	else
		add \1 to array @lines

	BTW: I sent these two messages yesterday, but they never reached the list.
Now I see that it comes somehow configured to "reply to sender". So nobody

I think this is possible in sed, but can't see it right now, but using
awk:

$ cat spenukl.dat
<a href="ind0000.html#i616">Blob</a>,
<a href="ind0000.html#i5">Blob</a>,
<a href="ind0000.html#i3556">Blob</a>,
<a href="ind0000.html#i3546">Doe</a>,
<a href="ind0000.html#i169">Doe</a>,

$ awk -F"[<>]" '!a[$3]{a[$3]=$0}; END {for(i in a) print a[i]}'
spenukl.dat
<a href="ind0000.html#i3546">Doe</a>,
<a href="ind0000.html#i616">Blob</a>,

$


NB order not preserved (this can be achieved but needs more code)

Here is a first seed for a sed solution

# to be invoked with -n
:a
N				# add next line to pattern space
/>\([^<]*\)<\/a>.*\n.*\1/{	# match 2 lines w/ same name
	s/\n.*//			# remove last line
	ta				# add another line
	}
P				# print first line of pattern space
D				# delete it
ba

The problem with this solution is that it won't print the last line,
since when EOF is reached on line 2, the line to print is still in
the pattern space, and sed exits without printing it.

This can still be made to work correctly, eg by invoking it like
this

	(cat file.txt; echo "") | sed -nf uniq.sed

but that is ugly. I can't think of a better way to do it right now
though.

Thanks for the suggestions.
I've ended up using a batch file, first calls sed -f to get the 
original file into shape, then uses uniq -f1 to sort by the second 
field only and finally another sed -f to neaten up.

   The most common use of sed is for find-and-replace operations.
Sed uses an s/// command which does these substitutions. For
example, to change the string 'hello' to 'world', one would use
the s/// command like this from a shell prompt:

      echo hello | sed 's/hello/world/'

   In English (and I don't know if English is your native language,
but we have many international users here, so I'm sensitive to
that), this is called "find-and-replace" or "search-and-replace"
quite often. Sed uses one-letter commands, and 's' was chosen
to stand for the word "substitution". So instead of writing

    s/find-pattern/replace-string/        # or
    s/regular_expression/replacement/

I often write "s/ubsti/tute/" instead, since I expect that
people know that the s/// command does substitution. For more
help on this point, see the sed FAQ, section 2 and beyond.

   http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/sedfaq.html

The word "cmd" is a common English abbreviation for the
"command", and by it I mean any valid sed command. Thus,

  { N; d; s/foo/bar/g; }

is a set of 3 random sed commands, and so is this:

  { h; x; =; }

So when I wrote:

>    sed '/^Postal Code:/!{ cmd1; cmd2; cmd3; }  file

I was trying to illustrate that you can match every line
except the lines which begin with "Postal Code:" and that
the curly braces {...} can enclose a number of separate
sed commands. I used 3 commands, and I expected the reader
to generalize from this that one could also use one
command, 5 commands, or some other number of commands.

Technically, there was a syntax error in the script I typed
in by hand, since I left off the trailing single quote
after the last "}" . Sed should alert you to the missing
quote mark if you enter this on the command line.


> When I give,
> sed '/^Postal Code:/!s' file
> I still get the original file with Postal Code lines included.

   That's because 's' by itself doesn't change anything.
To change each line except those that start with "Postal
Code:", try this on a small sample:

        sed '/^Postal Code:/!s/^/ >>> /' file

   Well, I have to close this message. Sorry that I was a
bit confusing in my last message. I'll try to express myself
more clearly from now on.

Kind regards,

Eric Pement

man sed is your friend. Or a book on sed.

Use the delete command, 'd' command:

sed '[Address]d' 
where [Address] can be a line number, the symbol $ (for last line) or a 
regular expression enclosed in slashes.

Here you want to specify lines that start with Postal Code:, so the sed 
command is
	sed '/^Postal Code:/d' file > output

Now go find a sed book or read 'man sed' ;-)
Alternatively, do as Eric suggested and avail yourself of the wisdom to be 
found in http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/sedfaq.html

Sven

Okay here goes, using Super-sed 3.59 and uniq from WUUP 1.00a 9/9/97 
release written by a novice, maybe inelegant solution but it does the 
job.
No need for using sort, the original file is already sorted into 
alphabetical, and want to preserve that order.

Batch file:
ssed -f  one.txt persons.html > blob1.html
uniq -f1 blob1.html > blob2.html
ssed -f two.txt blob2.html > surnas.html
del blob*.*

spaces are changed to #'s
later #'s are put back to being spaces

original line:
<a name="i869"></a><a href="i869.html">Mary Ann le 
Roux</a>&nbsp;<i>____ - 14 Jun 1996, Baltimore, MD, USA</i><br>

one.txt:
s/le Roux/le#Roux/g                 
s/<\/a>//g                                 
s/&nbsp;.*$//
s/$/<\/a>,/g
s/<a name="/<a#href="ind0000.html#/g
s/<a href=.*">//
s/ <\/a>,/<\/a>,/g
s/">.* /"> /g

line becomes:
<a#href="ind0000.html#i869"> le#Roux</a>,
has only one space in it for uniq to see as field separator

two.txt:
s/ //g
s/a#href/a href/g
s/le#Roux/le Roux/g

line is now:
<a href="ind0000.html#i869">le Roux</a>,

Have you gotten any help?
Sed is likely not your best choice. The following does what you want, but
also sorts them for you.
sort -u -t">" +3 junk.txt 
Of course, you need to be using linux.

Replying to hpy_azizy, who on 16 Nov 2002 wrote:

Because as soon as you stated

   o[h] = 7

or whatever other number you assigned to o[h], you instantly created 
an array named 'o'. Then when you try to create something like

   k[o] = 13

you are creating an array, 'k', whose index is o. But 'o' is already 
an array. Awk thinks you are trying to create an array of arrays, 
which is not what you are trying to do. To fix the problem, put array 
subscripts inside of quotes. That is, do:

  o["h"] = 7
  k["o"] = 13
  print o["h"] * k["o"]    # now it works!

Watch this (using GNU awk v3.1):

---begin console output---
d:\4dos>>echo . | awk 'BEGIN{a[b]=5;c[d]=4;}{print a[b] * c[d]}'
20

d:\4dos>>echo . | awk 'BEGIN{a[b]=5;c[a]=4;}{print a[b] * c[a]}'
awk: cmd. line:1: fatal: attempt to use array `a' in a scalar context

d:\4dos>>echo . | awk 'BEGIN{a[b]=5;c["a"]=4;}{print a[b] * c["a"]}'
20

Hope this helps!

remind me of agrep:

  agrep -d '^$' foo file

i just love that program. :-)

i have to admit that i did not test your script, Al,
but if you can replace agrep for some special cases
with it - great.  and if this fits into one line
then it might get added to Eric's "sed1line.txt"..

Subject: SED compiler -- training wheels wanted
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Has anyone ever written a "SED Compiler" (for lack of a better term). While
the stripped-to-the-bone nature of SED has its appealing characteristics,
being easy to learn or work with is not one of them. If one existed, I
suppose that you might write something like:


Substitute(seperator_character/expression_to_find/expression_to_replace/flag
s)

And the compiler would turn this into a proper SED statement.

Now, many of you may be laughing as you recall that you learned SED while
walking barefoot ten miles each way in the snow to school where you ran SED
on an abicus, but not everybody can be as smart as you. That said, are there
any training wheels available for this bike?

  The old-timers on this list may recall that at one time
we actually discovered a Windows GUI (Graphical User Interface)
to sed. You typed in the "find" and "replace" patterns in a
Windows box, you used checkboxes to indicate whether you wanted
to replace globally or not, to print by default or not, and
a graphical file menu to select which files you wanted sed to
modify or not.

   The program actually ran bona-fide sed as an exernal app,
so you could use your preferred version of sed for Windows
or DOS (e.g., HHsed, GNU sed, etc.) behind the scenes.  I
actually had it running on my computer at home at one time.

   However, the discovery of this program never became very
popular, and I confess that I don't even refer to it in the
sed FAQ. I think that the reason is, anyone smart enough to
use sed is smart enough to avoid Windows or a graphical user
interface. Really, I think the other part was that the
installation of the program required manually selecting the 
path to sed.exe, command.com, a temp directory or somesuch,
and if you were smart enough to install it manually, then the
GUI would only slow you down. (smile)

   Is this the kind of thing you were looking for?

   Oh, almost forgot. At the time this was discussed, several
people pointed out that those who preferred a GUI find-replace
program would probably be more happy with a dedicated utility
written for this purpose, such as:

   - InfoRapid Search & Replace
   http://www.inforapid.com/html/searchreplace.htm

   - Icarte Lightning
   http://icarte.com/Lightning/

So, the idea of a GUI for sed never caught on (here, that is.)
Hope this helps.

i think you really should try the SED Debugger!
http://sedsed.sf.net

it shows you what happen on the PATT and HOLD space
between commands, generating a SED SCRIPT with the
debug commands from your plain sed script.

see:

prompt$ echo abc | sed -e 'h;s/b/./;H;g'
abc
a.c


prompt$ echo abc | sedsed -d -e 'h;s/b/./;H;g'
PATT:abc$
HOLD:$
COMM:h
PATT:abc$
HOLD:abc$
COMM:s/b/./
PATT:a.c$
HOLD:abc$
COMM:H
PATT:a.c$
HOLD:abc\na.c$
COMM:g
PATT:abc\na.c$
HOLD:abc\na.c$
abc
a.c


it also can indent, tokenize and HTMLize (colors!)
your sed scripts, see some samples at the
http://sed.sf.net site

SED took me lots of eyes-opened nights to learn the basics.
and some years on the sed{ders,-users} list to learn some
black magic  ;)

btw, the debugger idea (how to show patt/hold contents with
sed commands) occured me on the beach, on a rainy and cold day...

not a lost day at all...

Minor variation of your solution seems to work OK (GNU sed 4.0):

$ cat spenukl.dat
<a href="ind0000.html#i616">Blob</a>,
<a href="ind0000.html#i5">Blob</a>,
<a href="ind0000.html#i3556">Blob</a>,

Subject: Re: SED compiler -- training wheels wanted
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   


	I don`t think a GUI for SED is such a bad idea. I use one quite often, actually. The program Eric describes doesn`t make much sense indeed, but you can make a more smart GUI.

	I use Windows a lot, maybe I`m the only one here. I use a program called PowerPro (www.windowspowerpro.com). It does so many things I wouldn`t know where to start. The most frequent uses I make of sed are:
	- copying the entire content of my window and search a word in the clipboard (not all applications provide a decent search feature);
	- making quick bulk changes to the current file (save the usual Vi-enthusiast rap, it`s useless against me).
	So I made this Windows-style input box where I type my (one-liner) sed command/script. It is convenient because I don`t have to open a DOS box to run sed, and PowerPro can display the output in a handy Post-It style window from which I can copy the modified content. I can even have the output sent to the clipboard automatically, actually. So I have it ready to be pasted right away. Besides, I can automate it a little: if I type f pattern, PowerPro recognizes the pattern and runs a default "find" script: "/pattern/!d". If I type ff pattern, then another script is run so that the lines immediately before and after the matched line are included and give me context. The matched pattern is shown in upper case so I can spot it more quickly. PowerPro can detect the path to the current document, so if I type qq sed_command, the current file receives the output and is therefore changed. The input box has a command history, so I can run a command, see the result in the Post-It style window, and if I like the result I can run it again with qq. Since I use these a lot, I find it very refreshing not having to type the same commands in full over and over and over. So far, I have only these shortcuts/aliases because these are the ones I use often, but anyone could come up with others.
	
	Summing up, that`s all about how you use it.

I see a Linux-i386 file in the directory. Is this Linux only? or will it

Is there a windows(/dos) binary?

If not and if I have to install python, I assume that

GUIs are interactive.   sed is meant
to be used in streams.  hence the name:

$ man sed
  Sed is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic text
  transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).
  .. it is sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which
  particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

the programs eric describes does make sense.  too bad you didn't get it.

you can always improve GUIs, of course - but then they will work
only when you are using it manually, clicking the buttons.  see?

"piping".
if you are resistant to that, too,
well, then you certainly deserve
a system which does not have it. *grin*

so - grep, less, perl, shell, sed - it's all there.
it came with the system - for free. why not use it?

hmm... why make the \n its own group?  why
not simply use it literally in the regex?

and the word boundaries are included in the
groups, anyway.  are they really needed again?

wouldn't this suffice?:

  /\(\<.+\>\)\n\(\<.+\>\)\n\(\<.+\>\)\(.*\)\3\n\2\n\1/
   ^^^^^^1^^^   ^^^^2^^^^  ^^^^^3^^^^"junk"

seems like the strings are required
to be separated by newlines -
but between string3 and its match
there's ".*" aka anything.

so - how much of "anything" is there
or can there be in your data?
is there a newline required?

would the following example give a match?

  string1
  string2
  string3 .* string3
  string2
  string1

the description to your problem
does not really give a structure
to the data, so your script might
just be working on *your* data.

why not share some examples so
we can see whether your solution
actually *is* a solution to the
problem?

Of course not, but sed is specifically designed for batch editing. If
you are going to use it interactively I fail to see why you don't
just use your editor instead, like Emacs. (Not that I mind new uses
for sed of course.)

Which Linux shell? Bash? By what you are saying above, I get the
feeling that you are not too familiar with Unix shells. In that case
I wouldn't make the statement that they are not enough -- they are
more than enough. Korn shell for instance is also a fully-fledged
programming language, with floating point arithmetics etc.

X has a clipboard. I usually just mark things with the left button on
the mouse, and paste it with the middle button. If I need to
copy-paste in the same text (ie not between windows), I use Emacs
which has excellent clipboard abilities.

Some OSes are closer to perfection than others, though. :-)

That depends on what you want to do. If I want to look through a
file, chances are I'll use less interactively. Then I can do RE
searches just by using the '/'-command. Hardly a lot of typing.

But can you write shell functions on your platform? :-)

> Is there a windows(/dos) binary?

YES!
today i finally had some time to learn about the py2exe program.
i've tested here on a win2k machine and it seems to work right.

so, windows users who DON'T have the python interpreted installed,
you could just download the

  http://sedsed.sourceforge.net/sedsed-0.6-windows.zip (480Kb)

file, expand the ZIP, go to the sedsed directory on MSDOS
and type 

  sedsed --help

to see if it is working.

please tell me any bug!

python is pretty easy to install, give it a try!

you can download the new win version of the debugger (480Kb)
or install the python interpreter and just download the debugger
script (40Kb).

Anyone know of alternatives to the DOS window (with decent cut'n'paste, scrolling etc??)

hi all,

flames! flames! :)

maybe luciano could have a point on the GUI issue.

SED, as a hard to learn language/editor, claims for documentation
and tools to guide the real beginers.

we have some really nice examples as the eric's FAQ/oneliners and
paolo's grabbag.

there is also a "middle" book by o'reilly (sed & awk) and other
lost documents on the net.

this mailing list is also a really nice place for lerning sed!


but comparing to SED's power and "abstract thinking", maybe it's
not enough to confort newbies.

some aditional tools would be very welcome!

the one i can talk about is the debugger. seems that i'm talking
very much about it lately, but i find it a VERY handy tool when
you do some complicated sed tricks.


let's talk about a equivalent issue: REGULAR EXPRESSIONS.

the same talk about "who will use regex, must know it"
"no GUIs are needed", "old dinossaurs never use gui",
"a jedi writes regexes by hand"...

but is a fact that today, there are LOTS of GUIs to build,
test, explore a regex. with colorized text, buttons, windows
and all those fancy things. and they are useful!

i really think it would be easier for me to learn regexes if
at that time there were those tools available...


back to SED.

i can think of a SED GUI tool that could be nice for beginners
and maybe even experienced users.

first, the tool will know about ALL sed versions around, knowing
the differences between them, so, you can feed it a sed script
and it rewrites it to work no a old (HP-UX?) buggy sed. and the
other way too.

with this database, it could just verify and tell you exactly
on WHICH sed versions the script would run the way it is.
(it's a pain now to know it "by mind")

ok, until now the GUI presence is not mandatory, cause a cmdline
app would do it.

for GUI, some kind of a wizard that generates sed code would be
nice. (and of course, for possible extensions, it could generate
perl/awk code as well)

the application would store a "script" as an internal form, or
a GNU sed 4.0 form, and could dump a working sed script for 
any version of sed.

on the wizard, the user can know NOTHING about sed, but just 
answering questions, or another way to tell the program
"what he whats to do", a sed script could be generated.

like, user gives some sample data (text).
then he highlight some portion of it (address / pattern)
then he selects what action he wants to do with it (command)

this way addresses (even ranges) could be specified easily.
the user will **see** what the address matches.

the other way could work also.

the user specify the address "by hand" and the program highlight
the text portion that matches that address (just like vim 
incremental highlight search).

mmmmmmm, what else.

maybe accept perl/awk code and transform it to sed code.

debug script execution with breakpoints, windows, all the "suite"
things other languages have.

integrated documentation, with search


well, after all i'm still not sure if it worths the effort &:I

hi,

the SED debugger output is colorized (yellow) on the COMM: line
(command) on linux.

for the windows version, the ESC[33;1m sequence did not work
here (win2k).

anyone knows or could point me to some doc where i can find how
to do it on MSDOS?

thanks.

 "When you have a hammer then

but, sure - feel free to use the other tools later.
please give us some feedback on why you would
suggest the use of tools other than sed...

i think you would *really* enjoy the GUI shell.

> > so you programmed something like this:

well, $PAGER is the value of the PAGER variable.
the shell evaluates it before the pipe gets executed.
typical examples are "more" or "less" or "most".

it also means "chose your favourite pager" to
view the results.  on windows you'd probably
have to have another application for that..

> >   foo | sed > /dev/clipboard

you certainly know about windows clipboard -
but have you found the clipboard on linux yet?
there certainly is one - and there are several
nice applications that go along with it, too.
one which comes immediately to mind is "xclip".

> >   cp /dev/clipboard file
> Then what?

> every time you need to use the clipboard?

why - of *course* i don't type all this every time!
that's what the shell is for too - abbreviations
like aliases and function.  didn't you know?

here is an eaxmple:

  alias -g cb  /whatever/long/and/complicated/path/and/file
  alias -g foo /another_/long/and/complicated/path/and/file

then all it takes for the copy is

  $ cp cb foo

done.  it certainly beats calling a GUI.

i don't see how this is different with windows.
or with any system.  or any other adjustable,
configurable, versatile program.  *shrug*

no GUI is perfect, either.
(hey - we're back at the *subject*!)

"abbreviations".  "functions".

speak these words slowly!

try.. to.. understand.  it's ZEN...

  $ function G { grep -C $1 file }
  $ G foo
  $ G bar
  $ baz

see?  easy.  GUI *that*!

and if there are more files then
the shell's "power of globbing"
can help you apply it more files:

  $ ls f* b?r
  bar baz foo foo2 foo-verylongname

  $ for i in foo* b?r; do
     G $i
   done

ommmm...

wrong.
the "-C" options *gives* you Context.
check the manual of Gnu grep.

> >   perl -pi.bak  -e 's/RE1/RE2/gi' <files>

you can abbreviate the command -
everything but RE1 and RE2.
these you'd have to type them
into your PerfectGUI, anyway.

> >  :set viminfo=%,'50,"100,:100,n~/.viminfo

cryptic - yes.  but as you are fond of GUIs you
might as well come up with one with looks like this:

    %   save&restore buffer list:     [x]yes  [ ]no
    n   name of viminfo file:         ~/.viminfo
    '   save marks for N buffers:      50
    "   save N lines of registers:    100
    :   save N lines of commandline:  100

but have you ever tried to send a
configuration *dialog* via email?

        - - Like this: I`m using my favorite editor. Windows editor. It`s extremely close to perfect, except its regex implementation is rather flaky. So I run sed on the text. May I? Thanks. BTW: I`m left-handed too.
        Sorry, I actually respect and even like Linux, but I hate Vi and Emacs. Countless nix applications still haven`t been surpassed by any Windows application, but Vi and Emacs are most certainly *not* two of them. If you want to cook with wood, play Atari or listen to vinyl records, fine. Live and let live. Personally, I prefer the best of both worlds.

        - - I deserve it for being lazy. I meant "not pleasant enough", and I thought my short phrase would be clear. My bad.

>X has a clipboard...

        - - As a compulsive clipboard user, I find it a major pain to use the clipboard in Linux. No OS is perfect...

>> Morale: no OS is perfect.
>Some OSes are closer to perfection than others, though. :-)

        - - "Perfection" is totally subjective.
        When in Windows, I miss the bash shell terribly. When in nix, I miss the extremely nice GUI environment. X just sucks. If you don`t need GUIs at all, sure, nix is your heaven.

>But can you write shell functions on your platform? :-)

        - - No, and I really wish I could. There is a little nice workaround, though. If you want to know what it is, you`ll have to read the reply I`m sending to Rob Simpson. I don`t think you need it at all, though.
	
        Are we done with it yet? These OS war discussions are almost fruitless, and I`m in a rotten mood today...

bash.exe, ksh.exe or zsh.exe - within an rxvt.  see sig.

but the topic of "what is better on windows"
only  applies to "sed" on this list.

so discussions about
"sed GUI" vs "sed CLI"
are just about on topic..

such tools are available.  have you ever looked for any?
a quick search on google reveals eg these tools:
  http://www.codeproject.com/string/Regex__.asp
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/kodos/

and there are many more.  google for them!

and then the only problem left is to get the script from

how about a MindGUI?  you enter all you know into a database -

you probably need one of the latest machine

I'm sorry, but if you are going to speak loudly on things which you
know nothing about, I feel a need to correct you. Emacs is /vastly/
superior to anything you can find on Windows (except of course Emacs
on Windows :-). Emacs has more functionality than probably any other
editor.

I'm sorry, but you have no clue. Cooking with wood or vinly records
is perhaps akin to using Notepad. Emacs is truly state-of-the-art.

I'll admit Emacs is not for everyone, and if you don't like it you
shouldn't use it, but as far as functionality is concerned Emacs is
simply the most powerful of editors.

Ok. Just stop bashing things of which you have no clue. Note that in
contrast I have not made any uninformed statements about your editor
or platform of choice.

i am sure you would name the applications
which probably put emacs and vi to shame - but
then you maybe know that a few adjustments of
either will make them look like your $editor.

you know, you could adjust linux to
get the same GUI as you have on windows.
but why hasn't anyone done that yet? hmm...

now, if you could see the source to windows,
edit and improve it, and then also to give
away the enhancements to everyone for free -
then you'd probably end up in jail, right?

i think your arguments on this are really compelling.
too bad i cannot afford windows.  it's... too good.

> Are we done with it yet? These OS war discussions

yep, we should ll get back to the subject of sed gui.
what, exactly, will be the benefits from that?
less typing?  maybe.  less thinking?  i doubt it.

Er..? use ed or ex if you don't want sed on streams. If you want sed with
a UI, use vi. If you want a GUI, use elvis, vim, nvi, etc. If the gui on
those isn't what you want, then what on earth do you want? They are as
close to sed+GUI as it is possible to get.

grep regex files

you know regexes from vi, so that's about all there is to it. Man grep if
you get more curious.

What is not enough about it? Try to be more specific? Also are you
referring to the terminal or the shell? there's lots of both.

Anything that splits the output in to screen fulls. like more and less.

I believe that there's a program which you can pipe something to which
sticks the input in to the X windows cut buffer if that is what you want.

Try using tab completion or relative paths. They save a lot of time.
Or define export CLP=/tmp/clip.$UID

cp $CLP ...

OK put in your .bashrc:
function showpat()
{
  p="$1"
  shift
  grep -C "$p" "$@" | less +/"$p"
}

then do

showpat regex files

or whatever. if you don't want to use LESS, use ANSI sequences and output
it straight to a terminal.

Subject: do what i mean
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

AI has tackled RE's (regular expressions)

on the inet
i came across learnt papers:

1- to extract/induce/deduce RE's from examples
2-                               using diagrams
3-                                     genetic algorithms.

some genetic algorithms can produce LISP programs
to solve standard AI puzzles, etc
tweaking those, may mechanize RE's, also.

Greppes: GREP's that Edit with Many Options. Two Programm
or Admin tools for Investigation and Change of any files
ANY PC's that use MS-DOS 2.0+. Oriented towards English b
characters but can be adapted for other languages to incl
UNICODE double byte words. PDGREPPE: Pattern Definition G
with Pattern Editing FGREPPE: Fast or Fixed GREP with Pat
Editing. Each uses (CLI) Command Line Interface and can b
customised for International Text bytes, data logging, de
directories, environment and extended command line files.
can edit by interactive or automatic modes with full resp
for file-sharing properties. User must specify DOS 8.3 fi
names. Options are available by menus of FILE, VIEW, SEAR
REPLACE, MISC & HELP. PDGREPPE has other menus for DEBUG
DEFINITIONS. PDGREPPE searches by Extended Regular Expres
similar to EGREP on UNIX systems. FGREPPE is more simple
FGREP on UNIX systems and does a search and replace based
FIXED patterns. NLX can change text files ordinarily used
UNIX or Apple MAC into MS-DOS usable ones. STRINGS rips
sequences of text characters out of binary files so You c
see their innards. HEAD gives You more! Of the front, mid
or end of files. ALL feature screen paging, line wrap, hi
light of match areas, recursive descent into file system,
multiple drive specification and MANY other options as

        Aurelio,
        Great ideas, as usual. Are you going to make them come true?  ;-)
        Just kidding.
        What you describe sounds a lot like Visual Regexp, which is a terrific tool. It also sounds like you want to make "Visual Regexp meets txt2regex", don`t you think? Sounds very nice indeed. 
        Converting between awk/perl and sed, say you? Hmmm... bold you are, but easy speaking is. 
        I still didn`t have a chance to try sedsed, but I will.
	
        Take care,

so - what else is new?  now, if someone
out there has a "sed" in genetic code
then we would be on topic again.  :-)

but i do not think that some GAs
will be able to read our minds
and "do what we mean".

i could be wrong though and
my cat may be reading my mind..

at least all this GUI flamewar teached me something:

    cp /dev/clipboard file

/dev/clipboard works on cygwin! i did not know that.

Subject: How to add a cntrl character in sed output?

Hi all!

I've been on the list for quite sometime now, though I've been quite a
silent member. I've been learning quite a lot sed, thanks to you, guys.
Today, something's stumped me beyond means:

I wish to replace a character with a newline. For eg, the following

123456778091214903934235230093213

would output (after going through sed), as

123456778
912149
393423523

93213


I tried sed 's/0/\n/g', 's/0/\\n/g', and 's/0/\0x10/g' etc, but those
didn't seem to work fine.

Thanks and regards,

--

Subject: loops: howto replace a block with something else?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I have header files like the one attached.

I want to clean-up the "extern void func(arg)" stuff, replacing this mess with

extern "C" void C_FormBaseApplyCB(FL_OBJECT *, long);
extern "C" void C_FormBaseCancelCB(FL_OBJECT *, long);
extern "C" void C_FormBaseInput1CB(FL_OBJECT *, long);
extern "C" void C_FormBaseInput2CB(FL_OBJECT *, long);
extern "C" void C_FormBaseInput3CB(FL_OBJECT *, long);
extern "C" void C_FormBaseOKCB(FL_OBJECT *, long);
extern "C" void C_FormBaseRestoreCB(FL_OBJECT *, long);

This little script creates my desired block and puts it in a file "extern.tmp"

#! /bin/sh
HIN=form_preferences.h
EXTERN_FUNCS=extern.tmp

sed -n 's/extern void \(.*\)/extern "C" void \1/p' ${HIN} > extern.tmp

if [ -s ${EXTERN_FUNCS} ]; then
	sort -u ${EXTERN_FUNCS} > tmp
	mv -f tmp ${EXTERN_FUNCS}
fi

My problem is replacing the current "extern void" stuff with the contents of 
extern.tmp. 

I guess that I need some sort of loop to delete everything between the first 
and last occurance of "extern void" and then append the contents of 
extern.tmp to the pattern space.

Unfortunately, loops leave me baffled. Can someone put me out of my misery?

Angus

Put this in a script.sed
s/0/\
/g

sed -f script.sed your_file

Alternatively, from the command line
aleem@pneumon:aleem-> sed 's/0/\
> /g' your_file
123456778
912149
393423523

93213

You have to use a literal newline for the substitution (ie hit
the "return" key) in combination with a backslash (which shows that
the command continues on the next line), like so:

	s/0/\
	/g

Subject: Deleting lines that end with 500
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hello,

I am new to the group and RE.  If this is to low level for the group 
let me know.

I have a file with line ending in different numbers.  I would like to 
delete lines ending with 500 and not ones ending with 5000.

I've tried the following:

sed '/500/,/$/d' file  (Deleted lines that end with 5000)
sed '/500/,/^$/d' file  (Deletes all lines but one)
sed '/500$/d' file   (Does nothing at all)

This is the file I am working on.  It is copied from "UNIX Shells by 
example 3rd edition" by Ellie Quigley.

Do you have a lot of header files? I would use a block construct
instead, eg

extern "C" {
...
}

Maybe something like this would work:

/^#define/a\
extern "C" \{
/^#endif/i\
\}
s/^extern //

Good idea.

Moreover, I finally worked out that what I was really trying to do was delete 
the junk and then insert the sorted, minimal list at a particular point. No 
need for the loop stuff. This does it perfectly:

# Delete blank lines, "extern void" function declarations and fdesign comments
/^$/d
/^extern void/d
/Callbacks, globals/d
/generated with fdesign/d


# Replace the line containing "Forms and Objects" with the contents of
# file "extern.tmp". This is a sorted, unique list of the function
# declarations
/Forms and Objects/ {
s/.*//
r extern.tmp
}


One question: In the "Forms and Objects" block I need the s/.*// line. Why? Ie

/Forms and Objects/ {
d
r extern.tmp
}

doesn't work. Why not?

being new is not a problem.
openly saying so is a plus.

a problem description at the start - good! :-)

> I've tried the following:
> sed '/500/,/$/d' file  (Deleted lines that end with 5000)

this deletes blocks starting with a line
which *contains* "500" *anywhere* in it-
unto a line which has a line ending;
so this should be the next line.

so that's why lines containing "5000" get
deleted - because the contain  "500", too.

> sed '/500/,/^$/d' file  (Deletes all lines but one)

here the ending line of the block is an empty line -
a beginning-of-line (^) followed by an end-of-line ($).

as your input is one single paragraph
and has "500" on the second line
sed would delete from the second
line unto the end of the data,
leaving only the first line.

> sed '/500$/d' file   (Does nothing at all)

this should delete all lines which have
"500" right before the line ending.
this is what you were looking for.

however, if you expect that the input
file gets changed - no way.  feature.

sed changes the input stream - which
is then a *copy* of your file.
look at the output of this command.
the "500$" lines should be gone.

redirect the output to a file, say "output":

  sed '/500$/d' file > output

now take a look at the differences
between "file" and "output":

  diff file output

the output is:

  2d1
  < Betty B:245-836-8357:635 Cutesy Lane, Hollywood, CA 91464:6/23/23:14500
  10d8
  < Paco G:835-365-1284:454 Easy Street, Decatur, IL 75732:2/28/53:123500

"2d1"  -- delete line #2  in "file" and
"10d8" -- delete line #10 in "file"
to obtain "output".

so sed did actually delete two
lines from the *copy* of "file" -
the line which ended in "500".  qed.

Thank  you, Michael and Angus. The solution works great!

Because the d command deletes the contents of the pattern space and

Hello,

I am new to the group and RE.  If this is to low level for the group
let me know.

I have a file with line ending in different numbers.  I would like to
delete lines ending with 500 and not ones ending with 5000.

I've tried the following:

sed '/500/,/$/d' file  (Deleted lines that end with 5000)
sed '/500/,/^$/d' file  (Deletes all lines but one)
sed '/500$/d' file   (Does nothing at all)

This is the file I am working on.  It is copied from "UNIX Shells by
example 3rd edition" by Ellie Quigley.

The last one should work. It matches 500 immediately followed by
end-of-line. Are you sure that there is no whitespace following the
500?

Reply-To: 1ns0mn1a <1ns0mn1a@gmx.net>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hello listers,

could somebody give me a hint how could I split
the result of a sed-manipulated file to more than
one file (on a windows box with gnu sed) ?

I've tried "csplit" for windows, too, but either I
did something wrong or the utility has a problem
itself.

 >csplit 1 {*} myfile
returns an error message (and, of course, no
output files :-( )

How do you want to split it? You can always use the w command:

/line1/,/line2/w file1	# writes the lines in the interval to the
			# file "file1"
/line3/w file2		# writes the matching line to the file
			# "file2"

What is the pattern that you are trying to use with csplit, is it "l"
repeated as many times as possible?  Also the windows port of csplit
that I have expects the filename to precede the pattern, i.e., csplit
[option] ... file pattern ...

You can effect the same process using sed or awk, but we would need to
know more of your requirements to be able to help.

yep
I tried to split to one line, repeated as
many times as possible. After the last line from
the original file csplit complains that it cannot
repeat the pattern any more (I can believe it, my file
has a limited number of lines :-> ), I really
don't understand the sense of this error message...
If I give instead of {*} the number of lines of the
original file it works perfectly.

> You can effect the same process using sed

All I want to do is to generate a html index from a
directory listing. After I add to that listing the necessary html
tags I want to save every line from that file as a
(separate) html file.

I'll keep trying.
Thanks for all the answers.

Subject: a shell script ?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   


Dear all,
I want to do the following in a sell script (csh)


=================
if file.err exist
	then
            mv  x1 y1
      else
           mv x1 y2
fi 
==================

How do you check if file.err exists. I used -f after if, but the shell did
not like it.

Thanks,
Hassan

Really the only thing you need to know about csh is not to use it.  Please use a different shell, if only for your own sanity.

man sh-posix
man korn
man bash

This is sh of course (Bourne shell).  Please don't use csh.

Some seds have line length limitations, so this approach may fail.  The
safer solution is to use tr:

    tr '\n' ' ' <infile >outfile

well, web servers can generate directory listings on the fly.
ever tried that?

but if you really need to save every link to each file
in another file (i wonder what that is for, but..)
then you do it with a simple for loop like this:

  $ mkdir test; cd test; touch foo bar baz
  $ for file in *; do
      echo '<a href='$file'>'$file'</a>' > $file.link.html
    done
  $ ls *link*
  bar.link.html baz.link.html foo.link.html
  $ cat *link*
  <a href=bar>bar</a>
  <a href=baz>baz</a>
  <a href=foo>foo</a>

no need for "sed" at all.  *shrug*

they may do this but unfortunately is not what I
need.

> but if you really need to save every link to each file

I need to save *every line* from a 'source file' to a
separate file, each single line in a new file. Since the
'source file' is sed-generated I thought
that maybe sed can do the rest, too. I tried
'csplit', too, but for some mysterious reasons it
didn't work.

kind of 'homework' ;-)

sounds nice, the only problem is that I use and
abuse my sed on a windoze, I told you this
already, in my first posting.

I still hope ;-)

Subject: csplit and sed
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Sorry that I haven't been active as much. I just finished a 3 hour 
economics exam, and went straight to bed. I'm awake now, and am 
willing to discuss the csplit problem. "Insomnia" (man, how I feel 
that name!) wrote:

I know that you're generally a Windows user, but more details would 
help me answer this one better. Here's my setup:

Right now, I'm running Win98SE (SE = "second edition"), with 4DOS as 
the command shell. I run a full suite of GNU text utils compiled for 
32-bit DOS/Windows with DJGPP, which I got from simtel.

    http://www.simtel.net/pub/djgpp/v2gnu/

File to download is 'txt20b.zip' (b stands for binaries). The version 
of csplit I'm using is version 2.0.  csplit works like this:

Given a command line like:

    csplit input.txt "/./" {*}

where the first parameter is a filename and the second parameter is 
the regular expression for any character, csplit will split that file 
into N+1 output files, where N is the number of lines. If input.txt 
contains 15 lines, you'll wind up with 16 output files, the first of 
which will be empty ("why" is not relevant at this point).

Those files will be named:

   xx00   - This is the empty one
   xx01   - contains line #1
   xx02   - contains line #2
   xx03   - contains line #3
   ...
   xxN    - contains the last line of the file

xxN will be generated and will contain all the text of the last line, 
even if the last line of input.txt doesn't end with a newline (in 
DOS, that's a CR/LF combination).

If you want to change the filename prefix from 'xx' to something like 
'work' (to get work00, work01, work02, ...), you use the -f switch 
like this:  

   csplit -f work input.txt "/./" {*}

If you expect to have more than 99 lines or if you just want more 
leading zeroes in the output suffix (work0000, work0001, work0002, 
work0003, ...), use the -n switch with a number, like so:

   csplit -f work -n 4 input.txt "/./" {*}

There are more switches, which you can find by "csplit --help" or 
"man csplit" (I put all my man files in the same directory, and have 
a batch file which calls 'less.exe' to view any files specified on 
the command tail; I don't really have a program called 'man.exe' on 
the DOS/Windows path).

If you are having trouble with this command, some things that come to 
mind are this:

(1) If you are using a Unix shell via Cygwin or MingW, maybe bash, 
csh, ksh, or something, perhaps the {*} is being expanded by the 
shell into a list of filenames. Try wrapping it in single quotes like 
'{*}' or prefix the asterisk with a backslash.

(2) If you have a file that contains a list of filenames, one per 
line, and you want each word/filename to become a file on the disk, 
and if you have WinNT/Win2K/4DOS/4NT, I think it would be better to 
use a for..in..do loop like so:

    for /f %a in ( input.txt ) do echo %a >%a

and if you need more refined parsing of input.txt, there is another 
switch which can be used:

    for /f "tokens=3,5,10" %a in ( input.txt ) do echo %a >%a

That being said, I offer this warning: This command works under 
4DOS/4NT (as I just tested it), but it may not work fully under WinNT 
or Windows 2000, because MS-DOS and MS-Windows normally perform 
output redirection ">to_a_filename" prior to parsing the command 
line. (I don't know how it works under Win2K; I'm just offering this 
as a warning.)

In simple English, that means that DOS tries to create >%a before it 
tries to interpret 'for /f %a ... etc....', which makes the %a 
variable. So you wind up with an output file before the output 
filename has been collected. I offer a work-around for this problem 
in the sed FAQ, at section 4.4.3, which explains the problem and the 
solution somewhat further.

If you write back, please be specific about what o.s. and command 
shell you're using, and also which version of sed (I recommend ssed 
if you can get it). If you can post a brief 4-line sample of the 
input files and desired output, that would help me quite a bit. Take 
care.

Eric,

That's one of the best explanations (if not the best) of how csplit
works, and how to use it under MSDOS command prompts, that I've seen.
One thing that may be worth mentioning is the -k option - this keeps the
output files when an error occurs and can be really handy when you're
trying to debug your csplit pattern(s).

Regards,
Peter

I have many files with many lines of comments. I want to remove all the

Sometimes they might be like this,

OR

How can I achieve this?

If strip.sed contains the sed commands below, then 
	sed -f strip.sed datafile > outputfile
should do what you want.
Regards, Angus

aleem@pneumon:aleem-> cat strip.sed
# strip.sed
# Delete all lines beginning with an arbitrary amount of white space
# followed by '#'. The bracketted expression contains a space and a tab
# ie [<space><tab>]
/^[     ]*#/d

# Remove everything after the '#'
s/#.*//
aleem@pneumon:aleem-> cat datafile
# A whole line comment
    # A comment preceded by some spaces
        # A comment preceded by a tab
keep this # strip the comment from this line
and keep this also


aleem@pneumon:aleem-> sed -f strip.sed datafile
keep this
and keep this also

Hi Payal.

You can strip out in-line comments like this:

s/#.*//

But rather than turning whole comment lines into blank lines you might like to delete them before this substitution of course.  So:

/^#/d
s/#.*//

But what if you have indented comment lines?

/^[ \t]*#/d
s/#.*//

You might need to replace "\t" with a real tab character.  Maybe you also want to strip the trailing white-space created from the in-line comment lines?

/^[ \t]*#/d
s/[ \t]*#.*//

Warning: untested code!  :-)

Best wishes,
Stew

Hi Payal

$ echo "test # comment\n# another comment" | sed 's/[   ]#.*$//;
s/^#.*$//'

OR

$ echo "do not rm this # but this comment
> # also rm comment at beginning of line
> but not this " | sed 's/[      ]#.*$//; s/^#.*$//'
do not rm this

but not this 


Explanation:
In the square brackets please enter a literal BLANK and a literal TAB
(if you use i.e. bash shell on UNIX/LINUX, you may enter this by
pressing the Ctrl+V then the TAB key on your keyboard).

First substitution removes all commments at the and of a line, 2nd subst
removes all comments at the beginning of a line.

For executing the 1st sample above correctly when using bash (instead of
ksh or csh), please ensure that at least bash 2.05 is installed the
shell option
  shopt -s xpg_echo
is set, otherwise the \n will not perform a "newline" in bash.

Hope this helps.

CU,
Roland

I have. It doesn't work because it's lacking a "print pattern space if the 
last line is encountered" statement.

This does work for me, now that I have tried it out. Did you use the -n
option with sed, perchance?

I cannot find any documention on dos2unix. This program is binary on my
machine. Such a conversion requires stripping off the \r from the \r\n
pair. so, I don't think that would work in this case.

Hi,

Anyone heard of a Java implementation of sed?  Or anything like it in
Java?

Reason I ask is I'm trying to use Ant to Java-fy some sed scripts I
wrote for post-processing ugly diffs from StarTeam's diff command.  I
wouldn't have thought of it, but someone at work is trying to push Ant
beyond its limits.

Thanks for any ideas,

Scott Stirling

Thanks a lot for the response. All the scripts works. I even tried them
from command line according to suggestions given by Roland. It also

Thanks again and bye.
With regards.

Nope. Can I ask, what should happen to the contents of the pattern space when 
N fails (ie, on the last line)? 

Here, it appears that the contents are just thrown away. (This is with the 
sed supplied as part of Digital's (Compaq's? HP's?) Tru64 Unix 4.0e.)

All is well if I ensure that N doesn't fail, so:

:loop
$!N
s/\n/ /
tloop

Used as: sed -f script.sed datafile

Angus

I don't think that you've invested much effort in trying, have you? Anyway, 
this works fine if you want to extract everything after the '#' character
	 sed -n '/#/s/[^#]*//p' datafile > outfile

"sed -n" suppresses all information normally written to standard output, so 
only things we specifically ask to output will be printed. 

In verbose form, the command above says:
For all lines containing a '#' character remove everything up to the first # 
([^#]* means all characters that are not '#'). If such a substitution occurs, 
then print the output.

If your datafile contains lines like 

insert into #temp1 but don't include this

where you wish to extract only '#temp1', then this will do it
	sed -n '/#/s/[^#]*\([^ ]*\).*/\1/p' datafile > outfile

Regards,
Angus

maybe on these cases using [:blank:] instead would not be easier
than the TAB+space visual confusion?

or there are some SEDs that doesn't understand it?

With sed you can just insert the shell command. Just keep in mind not
to surround it with single quotes.

sed '1i\
'"$(date)" file

In this simple case I would rather just do something like the
following though

(echo $(date); cat file) > new-file

Hi

You don't need sed, echo, date and cat is all you need:

  $ echo "$(date)
  > $(cat inputfile)" > outputfile

If your shell supports \n for "newline" you may also enter:

  $ echo "$(date)\n$(cat inputfile)" > outputfile

Cheers,
Roland

Depends on what the RE actually looks like. You could try this with 
sed:

   /RE1.*RE2/    # matches the 1st possibility
   /RE2.*RE1/    # matches the 2nd possibility

and with egrep:

   egrep 'RE1.*RE2|RE2.*RE1'

If your version of sed supports the alternation bar, which is rare 
except with seds derived from GNU sources:

   sed '/RE1.*RE2\|RE2.*RE1/'

With vanilla sed which does not support alternation, you can do this:

   /RE1/{/RE2/ ...;}   # to match them in either order.

Subject: Emptying hold space
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Having pasted the contents of the hold space back into pattern space with G, 
how do I ensure that the hold space is empty so that I can start afresh?

I tried G;h;d;x but this failed, presumably because d returned control to the 
top of the script.

Certainly, this works: G;h;s/.*//;x but is there a "better" way?

(I know I could initialise the space with h, but it seems cleaner to do this 
"at the other end".)

Subject: Matching RE1 AND RE2?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

This is probably a dumn question, but I'm stumped.

If 'RE1|RE2' matches either RE1 or RE2, how do I match both? 

This is to be used with both grep -E and with vanilla sed.

Regards,
Angus

Subject: merging every 5 lines to one line...? - anyone know how to do it with sed?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hello,

...let's say I've 100 lines text file and I'd like to have new file 
with 20 lines where:
each new line is "builded" from 5 old lines (1st new = old 1,2,3,4,5; 
2nd new = 6,7,8,9,10;......)

Could anybody please tell me how to insert asterix separating new 
lines?, ie:

new line 1
*
new line 2
*
new line 3


thank you in advance,
Chris

You can omit the cat and pipe, and shorten it to:

/usr/bin/dos2unix < input.fil > tmp.fil

mv tmp.file <target-file>

I don't see why you feel a need to do that? If you need the hold
space again, the mere use of 'h' will erase the old content anyway.
That could more or less be considered the default action, since to
explicitly keep the hold space contents you have to use 'H' instead.

Something like the following (untested):

	N
	N
	N
	N
	s/\n//g
	a\

This works for me

sed -f script_above datafile

GNU sed version 3.02.80
You'll have to add the last semicolon yourself.

Well I have many C-style structs

typedef {
	blah
	blah
	blah
	FL_OBJECT* obj1;
	FL_OBJECT* obj2;
	FL_OBJECT* obj3;
} FD_struct;

which I want to convert to C++-style
struct FD_struct : public FD_base {
	FL_OBJECT* obj1;
	FL_OBJECT* obj2;
	FL_OBJECT* obj3;
};

I don't know what blah is, so am not sure how to initialise the hold space 
when I hit the first FL_OBJECT. I do know when I hit the end of the struct 
though.

If you can think of something better than this I'd be grateful.
regards,
Angus

# We retain only those lines in the struct that start "	FL_OBJECT *",
# placing them in the hold space until the end of the struct is reached
# and we can ascertain the struct's name.

# All other lines are deleted:
/^typedef struct/d
/^	/{; /FL_OBJECT/!d; }

# 2. Append to the hold space and delete from the pattern space.

struct \1 : public FD_base {/

# 2. The hold space contains the FL_OBJECT lines, preceded by a new line.
#    To get rid of this new line, we exchange the contents of the hold and
#    pattern spaces, remove the new line and then exchange back.
x; s/^\n//; x

# 3. Paste the contents of the hold space beneath the "struct FD_xxx" line.
#    and empty the hold space
G; h; s/.*//; x

# 4. Close the struct and append an empty line.

If both means RE1 "then" RE2, then:

    RE1RE2

Can't think of what else "both" could mean.
You may have to give an example.

The quickest way to empty the hold space without changing
anything in the pattern space is this:

    x;s/.*//;x;

On my wishlist for ssed is a 'z' command, which would mean
"zap the hold space", and would be the equivalent of the
command just listed above.

I am aware that 'h' will overwrite the hold space, but I have
written several scripts where 'h' is not appropriate or usable
for the specified program logic. State machines, in particular,
generate a need to zap (delete) the hold space when a certain
condition is true.

sed exits immediately.  You'd normally see $!N for this reason.

Or you could use the & operator:

This creates trailing blanks, but Daniel's method removes these.

I would hasten to add one more thing.

Beginning with GNU sed v3.02.80 and up till now (the latest version
of GNU sed being version 4.0.3), when sed exits, it prints the
pattern space. Previous versions discarded the pattern space
(did NOT print it).

This can break some of the older scripts, and is contrary to the
described behavior printed in "Sed and Awk", by Dale Dougherty
and Arnold Robbins. I think the previous sed maintainer (Ken
Pizzini) had a difficult decision to make in changing the older
behavior, but I also think that ultimately he came down on the
right side in deciding to alter the behavior of N when it
reaches the last line.

I describe the reason for this a little bit in the sed FAQ
(scroll down to the very bottom of the file).

My only irritation is that this change was never documented
in the NEWS or the CHANGELOG section of the sed archives. I
really don't know how this got overlooked.

Your output is not directly derivable from your input:

line 4 of the input has 17 ds and the output 18 hs
line 5 of the input has 6 ds and the output 8 hs

Assuming that you intended that the number of hs should be the same as
the number of ds, then:

$ cat block.txt
Mainaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
ddddddddddddddddddddd
ggggggggggggdddddddddddddddddgggggggg
fffffffddddddxxxxxxxxxxxxMain
dddddddddddddddddd

$ sed '/Main/,/Main/s/d/h/g' block.txt
Mainaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
gggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhgggggggg
fffffffhhhhhhxxxxxxxxxxxxMain
dddddddddddddddddd

Subject: newbie question about -r -R switches
Reply-To: Bogdan Popescu <popescu@gmx.net>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hello Sed-Users,
  
  I'm still struggling with my first applications
  in sed and need I some advice from you:

  First: I really don't get the difference between
  the "-r" and "-R" switches in ssed 3.59

  Second: I'd like to merge two columns from two
  different files to a single file, I mean I have:

  file 1:

  one
  two
  three
  four

  file 2:

  111
  222
  333

  and I want to get:

  file 3

  one 111
  two 222
  three 333

  Can somebody explain me how to do that with SED
  ?

-- 
TIA,
Bogdan                          mailto:popescu@gmx.net

Would you consider doing this with "paste" instead?

$ paste file1 file2
one     111
two     222
three   333
four

There are various options to paste that should do exactly what you want.

I don't know anything about ssed, sorry.  Best wishes,
Stew

I will fix this in the next version (which will increase speed of
backreferences by the way).  Can I copy the section of the FAQ?

Status:   

Don't know nothing about French, but some versions of sed allow you to
specify hex, octal, or decimal ASCII characters with \x \o \d followed by
the code for the character. 
Do the French characters have simple ascii representation?

This little code suggests that they do. It outputs:
[snip]
Test  : 
Test  : 
Test  : 

Having said that, 
	sed 's//a/' trial.C
works for me too.

Angus

#include <ostream>
#include <string>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::string;

int main()
{
	string const sentence = "Je vais  la France pour parler franais.";
	cout << sentence << endl;

	string::const_iterator it = sentence.begin();
	string::const_iterator const = sentence.end();
	for (; it != end; ++it) {
		cout << *it << ' ' << int(*it) << endl;
	}

	cout << "Test  : " << char(-32) << endl;
	cout << "Test  : " << char(-6)  << endl;
	cout << "Test  : " << char(-25)  << endl;

	return 0;

If they do have a simple ASCII representation, od -x might show what it is.
That would solve the problem, maybe.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Opps.
sed "s/~/&\nxxx/"
might be better, although I haven't tried this.

Dos ends lines with \r\n, not just with \n like unix.
So,
maybe this would work:
sed "s/~/&\r\nxxx/"
(Haven't tried this, either.)

   Yes, you may copy the section. But if you would like, I also have 
Ken's messages originally posted here on sed-users pertaining to the 
N change, and I could re-post them here for you and others to read.

With -r by itself, you don't need the backslash for the following 
metacharacters or escape sequences. You can omit the \, like in 
egrep. (Think of -r as "regex extensions").

   (...) - used for grouping; use \( or \) for literal parentheses
   {M,N} - used for interval exps.; use \{ or \} for literal braces
   ?     - zero or one, instead of \?
   +     - one or more, instead of \+
   |     - alternation, instead of \|

With the -R switch, you get all of the above, and the -R also turns 
on Perl-style escape sequences and regular expressions, and also 
turns off older sed regexes. (Think of -R as "regex grown larger").

Perl-style escape sequences turned on:

  \A    - matches beginning of pattern space
  \Z    - matches end of pattern space or last newline in the PS
  \z    - matches end of pattern space
  \d    - matches any digit: same as [0-9]
  \D    - matches any non-digit: same as [^0-9]

Perl-style regular expressions

  [?+*]?    - minimal match of ?, +, or *
  (?i)abc   - case-insensitive match of abc, ABC, aBc, ABc, etc.
  ab(?i)c   - same as above; the (?i) applies throughout the pattern
  (ab(?i)c) - matches abc or abC; the outer parens make the 
difference!
  (?m)      - multi-line pattern space: same as "s/FIND/REPL/M"
  (?s)      - set "." to match newline also: same as "s/FIND/REPL/S"
  (?x)      - ignore whitespace and #comments; see section (9) below.
  (?:abc)foo   - match "abcfoo", but do not capture 'abc' in \1
  (?:ab|cd)ef  - match "abef" or "cdef"; only 'cd' is captured in \1
  (?#remark)xy - match "xy"; remarks after "#" are ignored.

  (?=regex)   - positive nonmatching lookahead
  (?!regex)   - negative nonmatching lookahead
  (?<=fin-re) - positive nonmatching lookbehind for finite regexes
  (?<!fin-re) - negative nonmatching lookbehind for finite regexes

This is as brief a summary as I can give.

   The Unix utility 'paste' is dedicated to the task you describe.

Subject: stripping headers
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi all,
I use mutt to read my emails. In one particular folder I receive all the
mails sent by a client who uses html format. I use mbox mailbox. Now I
want to strip all the html off the mails and make them plain. I can do
that using html2text. But I would also like to strip all the headers
too.
Can anyone tell me how to strip all the headers off the mails. Remember
the mails are always dumped in a single file (mbox format). So, I need
to remove all the headers of all the mails from a single file.
Can it be done? Any hints on this? 
Thanks a lot in advance and bye.
With warm regards.
-Payal

[using mutt to read HTML mail]

This doesn't really answer the question but can you use "lynx -dump" to read HTML mails instead?

Best wishes,

the trick with mutt is to have it ignore the text/html parts.
but this is a mutt issue.  we'll talk about this there.  and
i'm sure there's some module in perl which does it all...
but has anyone got other solutions with sed?  post them.

assuming (hey) that all your mails are in folder "foo"
and they are already stripped off the html parts,
use this:

  sed -e '/^From .*:..:/,/^$/d' foo > foo.decapitated

read the sed command like this:
  from    line with  "From..."
  to      line with  "^$" (empty line)
  delete

i do hope the pattern for the From_ line suffices as it simply
addresses those with two colons separated by two characters.

the format somewhat is this:
  From<space><address><space><date>

example from your mail:
  From address Fri Nov 29 14:19:50 2002

a pattern which should yield less false positives:
 /From [^ ][^ ]* .*[012][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]/,/^$/d

> Mail-Followup-To: Payal Rathod <rpayal@softhome.net>,
>        sed-users@yahoogroups.com

that's a superfluous header as senders to
this list are required to be subscribed.

so your mutt setup should have the command
"subscribe sed-users" which says
"i'm subscribed - no need to CC me".

i'd also answer with a macro for mutt -
but this ain't the mutt list.  ;-)

Does this mean, that I just have to do something similar with other
patterns like Reply-to:, Date:, etc.

OK now, I guess. Atleast I have put sed-users in .muttrc with subscribe
tag.

More about this later in mutt-users

no.  the From_ line should be the first line
for all messages in mailbox files.
all othe lines are within that first paragraph.
they will get deleted by the sed command.

This was originally posted to sed-users 3 years ago, shortly after 
the release of GNU sed v3.02.80.  I have trimmed the message headers 
to the bare essentials, and I have exercised the editor's privilege 
of silently correcting minor misspellings in any of the messages. The 
posters are Ken Pizzini, Greg Ubben, and me (Eric Pement). I'll 
separate messages with 4 hyphens (----).  

Ken Pizzini was at that time the sole maintainer of GNU sed.
Greg Ubben is a world-class sed script writer.

I suppose that since the change in behavior was intentional that I'd
consider this a "feature", but I'm interested in feedback on how
much the old behavior was _relied on_, rather than "worked around".
The 3.0x series treats a read of EOF (on the last input file) during
an N command the same as it does a q command.

I changed the behavior because I can see no text, whether in various
man pages or in the POSIX.2 specification, that suggest that the
traditional behavior could be considered "correct", rather than a
bug.  I particularly disliked how the behavior of:
  sed N foo bar
with traditional seds depended on whether foo has an even or an odd
number of lines, which is the actual "bug" that prompted the change
in behavior.

Interesting -- guess we shouldn't rely on this odd behavior any more.
Easiest portable fix for the above script seems to be adding the -n 
option.

Or use "$d;N", since this is what the traditional behavior really
did in the case of a single input file:
              sed ':a;$d;N;2,10ba;P;D' file

[late reply]

Off the top of my head, I suspect it is a pain more than helpful.
Especially when writing a script to read the next 9 or so lines
following a pattern match where you have to write
	/foo/{ $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N }
vs just /foo/{ N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N; }

(Though I guess that still wouldn't work if the intention is to do 
further
processing on the lines whether there were 9 more or fewer, as sed 
will
still quit.)  Think places where I used it to advantage were mainly 
as
shortcuts; I probably have a number of one-liners that assume this,
but larger scripts are less likely to rely on this.

Can I suggest that for things like this, that GNU sed respect a new
environment variable (eg, $GSED_TRADITIONAL) where if set, GNU sed
will keep the weird behaviors of traditional sed.  That way a huge 
shell
script that calls sed a zillion times to do complex editing only 
needs
to set this variable at the top if there are problems with some of 
these
changes.  (Can't remember other changes -- line ranges probably 
one...)

Subject: What should N do on the last line of input?

Now that it's been brought up, I'll change the subject header.

   Exactly what SHOULD the "N" command do on the last line of input? 
Should N silently discard the contents of the pattern space without 
printing it? This seems to be the historic behavior of sed for as 
long 
as I know -- it has also forced all sed writers to use two forms of 
syntax, namely, "$!N" when they want the pattern space to be kept and 

printed when sed reaches the last line and "N" when they want the 
pattern space to be discarded when sed reaches the last line.

   Now that the issue has been raised with GNU sed v3.02.80, I'm 
wondering where we could go to get an "official" response or 
decision. 
Is there a POSIX or IEEE committee that decides these things? While I 

am in favor of adding new features to sed (like "y/a-z/A-Z/"), I am 
more reluctant when the new feature departs from old peculiarities. 
Your guidance and suggestions are welcome.

   Feel free to cross-post this question to Arnold Robbins or other 
Unix gurus who have some working relationship with the POSIX 
committee.

  ***[END OF REPOSTING]***

   I never did receive a reply to that final posting of mine, but at 
the time, the sed-users mailing list was very busy, and there were 
many problems to solve (and resolve)!

   However, as I see now, some three years later, the questions and 
motivations aren't entirely gone, so I thought it might be helpful to 
remind us of some of this discussion.

This works great. But, it might falter if there is any more From: line

That's how your news/mail reader identifies the header and message body
separation according to the relevant RFC.  So if it works for your
reader it should work for sed too.

This is hardly a general solution, and I haven't figured out quite
how it works, but it works for me. It will not work with all versions
of sed. The odd behavior of N at the end of file and the size of the
allowable pattern space are two possible problems.

I use:
GNU sed version 3.02.80

:loop
N
s/\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n/
bloop     

sed -f scriptabove datafile

Did you wrap the expression in double quotes, like you should have?

   sed "s' /'/'g" infile >outfile

You could also use a different delimiter, if you like:

   sed "s| /|/|g" infile >outfile

If you still don't get any visible results, there are some less
probable explanations. You could have true tabs (0x09) instead of
spaces in the input file; so you could be trying to replace spaces
when you should be trying to replace a tab (not likely, but it can
happen). The 0x09 is programmer's notation for 9 hexadecimal.

The input file might have a pseudo-space: 0xFF looks just like a
space from a DOS prompt. From a DOS or a CMD window, it is entered
by typing ALT-255 from the numeric keypad. When you send the file
to the DOS or CMD screen with the TYPE or MORE commands, the space
(0x20) and the pseudo-space (0xFF) appear to be identical. The
only way to tell them apart is with a program that can dump to
hex or octal, or you can use sed's "l" (lower-case L) command:

   sed -n l infile

The value of FF in hex is 377 in octal, so you should see a "\377"
in sed's output if there are any 0xFF characters hiding in the file.
This is probably more than you needed to know, but I thought I'd
cover all the bases this time.

Subject: regular expressions.
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi all,
I am just learning a few things about reluar expressions. Can I ask
questions about it on this list? There is no list dedicated to regular
expressions as such. One on yahoogroups has only one mail in last few
months. seders use regular expressions quite widely so I assume they
know a lot about them.
Or if someone has a little time on hand I will mail it to her/him
offlist so as to not populate the list.
Thanks and bye.
With regards.

Solved, unexpectedly the file had double spaces where I was looking 
for single spaces. Now doing a s' \+' 'g followed by a s' /'/'g does 
works okay.

I'm removing the double-quotes by
s/\([A-Z]\) "/\1 /g

And when I have a 'Y', not only is it not removing the ",  but it is 
adding a tilda in front of the 'Y'.Does anyone know why (no pun

I can't see why you're getting tildes (what platform are you using?), but can you remove your double quotes by doing s/"//g instead?

Stew

1.	I'm working on a Linux box.
2.	I can't use s/"//g because there are instances where I'm needing to do
something different with the ", like following numbers or the plus sign.
3.	The tilde showing up turned out to be a terminal emulation issue - they
don't actually exist in the file. However, of almost 1000 changes to [A-Z]"
or [A-Z] ", there are 11 that if the " was the last character before the
delimiter, & a Y was the prior non-space character, I was not getting the
change - very weird. Rather than spend any more time on it, I added a line
to my script to get rid of the " in those specific instances.

Subject: Re: [Samba] printing problems
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

This goes letter on and one. There may be some useful information hidden in here.
First, the speculation (may skip to the FACTS section without lost of
information). You can skip right to the proposed solution section.

Well, just guessing here.

lpr has an option -K or -# which controls the number of copies.
So, when you print, unless your application just sends the print jobs
over and over, your client has to supply that number to the printing
command you have told samba to use.

Significantly, there is no option in smbclient (which I could find)
for giving the number of times to print a file with the print command.

SO:
Pure garbage follows:
The question becomes, is that number being sent from your windows client,
or is the job being sent multiple times. I would GUESS the former, since
that would be much more efficient in terms of network bandwidth. I would
look in various logs (log.smbd) and see if any such value is being sent. If
the value is being sent, you might be able to capture it in. I am not sure
where this information would be found in the documentation, since smb.conf
doesn't even talk about %J. 
==========End of PURE garbage==============

Now, for some FACTS:
I use lprng, not cups, whatever that is.

I have done an experiment, using abiword. When I print multiple copies,
without going through samba, the print job is sent as one big postscript
file. Naturlich, since postscript is the default printing language for
linux. My documents were one page long, and each document was just one extra page
in a big postscript file. This is not quite as bad for bandwidth as
you might think, because all the header stuff  and definitions, etc, are
sent only once. So, as far as the lprng printing software is concerned,
only one job has been sent.

Now, when I tried the same experiment with a windows client printing from
word via samba, using an HP laserjet III + driver, which gives postscript
output, the print file was slightly bigger with two copies vs one copy,
but, importantly, when I sent 11 copies instead of 4 copies, the print jobs
were the same size, In fact, they differed (diff) on only two lines

So, score one for the evil empire. They just use a loop to print more
than one job, (for postscript printing) rather then repeating the job
over and over in the postscript file, like abiword does.
Also, even with sending only one file copy, Word is much more efficient in
the postscript code it generates, at least in file size. How fast it runs on
the printing devices is another story.
The size of the print files are:
72289  <--Abiword's postscript output for "This is 9"
29851  <--Word's output "This is short"
They are more efficient at conserving bandwidth by a lot.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
What was your problem again?
Oh yes. Epson 800.  This sorta sounds like a driver problem.
Unless someone else has a better idea, and you don't want to endlessly
experiment, here is my generic solution to driver problems.  If you are
happy with the kind of printing you are getting from your linux server
locally, send your window client jobs to the same queue you use for your
linux jobs.  Choose the HP laserjet III plus driver on your clients. And
all should (might) be well.

Which queue are you sending your print jobs to from the windows client? It
needs to be a raw queue without a filter.

Even If I watch the queue from the WXP, I can see that nothing is going thru this port. Where is the file going? If I check the printer properties (ports), it seems that this particular printer is not point to anywhere. I don't even know whether the problem is from the XP side or Linux side. I know that the printer is configured properly on the Linux and is printing from there. I am attaching my SMB.conf as it's now. I am not a Linux expert. Just starting, so don't take for granted that I checked the easiest parts even. Thanks in advance.

Thanks--is the difference between 's/x/d' and '/x/d' is that the 
former would just replace a character "x" with the letter "d", while 
the latter treats the "d" as a delete command?

/x/ is used to match any line containing an 'x'. If a match is found, delete 
the contents of the pattern space (usually simply the line in question) and 
return to the top of the script.

Yes. To be more precise:
/x/d deletes the pattern space entirely and returns control to the top of the 
script.

/x/s/.*// clears the contents of the pattern space of it contains an 'x'. 
Control passes to the next command in the script.

More fine-grained behaviour can be obtained using the t (test) command with 
s///

Eg, if I have data 
blah blah blah
ID: 1
ID: 2
ID: 3
blah blah blah

Then this sed script should prove illumnating.
# the tloop command below returns control to here.
# Think of it as a goto command in c.
:loop
s/Robert/Steven/

# For any line contianing ID
/ID/ {
s/ID: 1/Angus/
t
s/ID: 2/Glen/
t
s/ID: 3/Robert/
tloop
}
# The t-command branches to here. Think of it as 
# a break command in a c-style switch, case block.

# The script continues with more sed commands...
/blah/s/l//g

Status:   

I'm going through someone else's (undocumented) script and I'm seeing 
a sed command as follows:

sed '/x/d' oldFile > newFile

I've read the SED FAQ's and am familiar with its simple 
substitution 's/old/new/g' commands, but am unsure what '/x/d' alone 
means.  Appreciate any explanation--this is probably very simple.

as the most holy books MRE tends to have a life of
its own (cough) 'habent sua fata libelli' (hope
I matched the spelling).

A couple of weeks ago I browsed on an obscure
public software repository and I found MRE
as a PDF file. Firstly I thought it was a kind of
'demo' but I discovered to be a full version of
the first edition. Shareware maybe? Advertising
for the second edition? I have no idea but I enjoyed
till now every line from it ;-)

So, if you think it is a good idea I could put it on the 'files
section' of the sed-users list, making it available to all
those cannot afford the paperback version.

Well, almost, but not quite!  The substitute command would be 's/x/d/',
that is _three_ separator characters (usually /, but can be something
else).  In addition the last separator character may be followed by a
flag which is numeric, g or p.

In /x/d the /x/ part is an address regexp (one that selects a line), but
in s/x/d/ neither the /x/ nor the d/ part is an address regexp, they are
parts of the substitution expression.  You can add an address regexp to
the s command thus:

/x/s/x/d/

this:
1) selects a line containing x (the /x/ part)
2) substitutes (s command) for the regexp /x/
3) the contents of the replacement (d/)

Hello friends,

it seems to me that a sort of "sed&awk" online
edition is available, too:

(my wget already did its quick and dirty job ;-))

i think i need a sed command to turn such "attributions" to one line..
(suggestions, anyone?  use awk instead?)

well, it *is* correct to assume that such
a line can be found within a message.
here's the one from your mail in my mailbox:

>From sentto-2489639-2431-1038694421-guckes=math.fu-berlin.de@returns.groups.yahoo.com Sat Nov 30 22:13:46 2002

now, your MTA might have escaped that line - or not.
if it does then you're almost safe.
if not, well, then you need proper parsing.

but i wonder whether sed can hold the complete 6,598 byte regex for
mail header (as defined by RFC822) from the MRE1 book on page 316..

Subject: Re: 2 blank lines for 3
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Thanks Joel,

I ended up squeezing multiple blank lines into one, wanted to preserve
major section blocks of a document I'm rendering but it wasn't worth the
complexity of extra files to the scripts.

I did try this method but it didn't work for me, I have GNU sed version
3.02 on both the RH and Debian boxin I tried it on.

The script yielded:
-----------------------------------
1linesabove=0
2linesabove=0

3linesabove=1


4linesabove=2nnn5linesabove=3


6linesabove=2nnn7linesabove=3nnn
8linesabove=4
------------------------------------

I tried `sed -e 's/\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n/' datafile` (more interested in
mastering the /N and /n commands than gaining the benefits of a loop) but that
left my original file unchanged.

1linesabove=0
2linesabove=0

3linesabove=1


4linesabove=2



5linesabove=3


6linesabove=2



7linesabove=3




8linesabove=4

Oh well, still curious. These commands from sed1line.txt gave me hope :*)
but still can't quite do it. (change 3 blank lines to 2)

 # delete all CONSECUTIVE blank lines from file except the first; also
 # deletes all blank lines from top and end of file (emulates "cat -s")
 sed '/./,/^$/!d'          # method 1, allows 0 blanks at top, 1 at EOF
 sed '/^$/N;/\n$/D'        # method 2, allows 1 blank at top, 0 at EOF

 # delete all CONSECUTIVE blank lines from file except the first 2:
 sed '/^$/N;/\n$/N;//D'

mind you, - the unix cd bookshelf has a copyright
allowing you to keep a copy for yourself - but you may
not make copies available online (see copyrght.htm).

well - do you have the rights own a copy of that pdf, too?

looks like these mails has spilled over from the samba mailing list
see http://lists.samba.org/mailman/listinfo/samba and especially
http://www.faqchest.com/linux/samba-l/smb02120311_16527.html

i have sent Joel a request for clarification -
but so far did not get a response.  if those
crosspost continue then i will probably
have to use a "ban" on Joel's address... :-/

Paolo,

This seems like a very useful idea - a search path for sed scripts.  I
use the facility in gawk quite a lot (it provides a default path if the
variable AWKPATH isn't set).  Would it be difficult to implement in
sed/ssed?

Hi Albert.

> Lets say I want to delete match and delete C and also delete 2 lines below it.

Do you mean you want to delete the line containing C and the 2 lines below it?

$ cat ttt
A
B
C
D
E
F
$ sed '/C/{
	N;N;d
}' ttt
A
B
F

There appeared to be blank lines between your lines in your example, but your problem of "the next two lines" didn't fit that problem, so I assumed that the blank lines were an email line wrapping anomaly.  Anyway, once you find the line containing C you read in the next two lines and then delete the pattern space.  I'm assuming that you won't hit the end of the file when reading in those next two lines!  It's a bit more complicated if that's a possibility but I'll leave you to investigate $!N

Best wishes,
Stew

hi roland,


my "who am i" here gives a different output, but yours can be
done in two steps:

1. delete trash from left (everything before '(' )
2. delete trash from right (everything after '.' )


> Problem:
> $ who am i
> username    pts/30       Dec  5 13:41    (hostname.domain.name)

sed 's/.*(// ; s/\..*//' 

or you can use groups, but personaly if think it ugly :)

sed 's/.*(\([^.]*\)\..*/\1/'

Subject: How to get the hostname?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi sed-users

"/usr/bin/who am i" delivers i.e.:

Problem:
$ who am i
username    pts/30       Dec  5 13:41    (hostname.domain.name)

Question:
How can I get by using sed (or exec????) as result only the hostname?

Result should be:
$ who am i | sed '???????'
hostname

Couldn't find by myself the needed regexp (???'s above) for filtering
that...

I really would appreciate any help.

CU,
Roland

I think you meant expr?

This is the sed expression, as given by aurelio

> sed 's/.*(\([^.]*\)\..*/\1/'

expr should be

expr `who am i` : '.*(\([^.]*\)\..*'

(tested with Bourne shell)

Just as a reminder, expr matches on the whole string, and if EXPR has a
parenthesized group in `expr HAYSTACK : EXPR', the command outputs its
match.  So it is equivalent to

echo HAYSTACK | sed 's/^EXPR$/\1/'

i don't see quite how you are going to do this because when you open the file for writing, it's
going to be clobbered, i.e., truncated to zero length.  that means there will be nothing there
for the sed script to read & alter.

Because /e in ssed means `send the result to the shell, and substitute
with the resulting output'.  In Perl, instead, it means, evaluate the
result as a Perl command, with some strange rules that I don't know
of and that allow you to write D x 100 instead of 'D' x 100. 
`EXPRESSION x NUMBER' is Perl for duplicating NUMBER times
the given string expression.

You could use a loop. I use bash, and something like this works:

i=0
while [ "$i" -le 9 ]
do
i=$((i+1))
echo $i
done

It's probably easier to use awk to do something like this if you require
a general solution to the problem "find the first upper case letter in
this string and replace it by 100 copies of itself".  I don't think it's
impossible, or even very difficult, to do purely in sed, but I haven't
looked at it.

$ # some of the output may have wrapped in posting

Note that lines that don't include an upper case letter are simply
printed as is.  To remove these from the output, delete the 1 (one) in
the last line of the script.

The are other, possibly more efficient ways of doing this in awk, but
the above is probably as easy to maintain as any.  It should also work
on all awks (apart from V7 awk) that I am aware of.

Hi, 

At first, thanks for your answers. But, this wasn't exactly my question.
I want to do this substitute of one char by a lot of chars in a command 
line like this one: sed 's/CHAR/CHAR2^100/', if possible.
I would know if there exists one way of doing so. As you can observe, this
line command should say that char CHAR have to be substituted one hundred 
times by char CHAR2.  

Thanks,

DLK

It's boring to do it with one command, but two do it:

s/[A-Z]/&&&&&&&&&&/
s/[A-Z]\{10\}/&&&&&&&&&&/

Or, to replace with L's

s/D/DLLLLLLLLLL/
s/D\(LLLLLLLLLL\)/\1\1\1\1\1\1\1\1\1\1/

QED (quite easily done :-)

Note how the first command keeps the D in place so that L's before that D
don't cause trouble, and the second removes it.

for chr in $(seq 1 9)

But seq is (quite a bit) slower.  Of course you can use backticks instead of
$(...) but my broken keyboard does not have them :-)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Status:   

Hi Sven

If I only had everywhere I want to a sshd running...

The task is: If I log into a system remotely and X is needed, how to set
DISPLAY correctly (if system doesn't do it by itself) on host where I'm
logging in/getting shell from?

However, if X is needed: telnet/rsh (whatever) to an AIX host does
unfortunately not return/set the DISPLAY variable of the client where I'm
logging in from. "/usr/bin/who am i" is delivering this info, placing it
into .profile (.bashrc, .cshrc ...) enables me to set DISPLAY
automatically...

ssh delivers by itself an encrypted X tunnel (eg hostname:12.0) (know your
unix tools... ;-)) and sets DISPLAY correctly...

Anyway: Thanks for help!

Cheers,
Roland

Subject: shell script question
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   


Dear all,
Apologize if this ? is not relevant to sed.

In the following script


===================================
for chr in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
do
    perform some task
done
===================================

how can you define something like 

for chr in 1 to 9

i.e. do not explicitly write 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9


I use sh or csh.

Thanks,
Hassan

Here we do a pure sed version. Use a 'for' loop to accumulate
the 100 chars we are replacing the match with. As before (my
previous 'for' loop post) count in unary (cause it is nice to
match) with '.'s in hold space:

#!/usr/bin/sed -f

GNU sed 4.0 and super-sed both support a -i switch to do this (like Perl).
They use the temporary file internally.

so you want "in place editing/substitution".

  perl -pi.bak  -e 's/RE1/RE2/gi' <files>

perl is just a bloated version of sed -
but it sure has some nice features.  ;-)

Here is the easiest solution thus far:
s/D/DDDDDDDDDD/g
s/D/DDDDDDDDDD/g

sed -f scriptabove file

It is pure sed and only takes two lines!
You just have to write one line, then copy and past as many additonal lines
as you want.

You migh define a variable to hold 100 D's, and use that as the substitute,
#!/bin/bash
i=1
while [ "$i" -le 100 ]
do
var="$var"D
echo $i
i=$((i+1))
done
sed "s/D/$var/g" datafile
I haven't tried this out.

Replying to Diego, who on 5 Dec 2002 wrote:

Assuming that the long search pattern must match exactly:

perl -pe "s/1111111111rjljfdlkjfDjkfdjkfslkfdksl/D x 100/e"

and if a partial match would suffice, then I'd use that instead:

   perl -pe "s/ljfdlkjfD/D x 100/e"

I tried using ssed with the /e switch, but ssed for some reason tried 
sending the search pattern to the shell for execution. This is the 
shortest solution I can think of.

Search the www for awka - this is a freeware compiler for
awk.  You will need to compile it yourself to run under
Windows.

    D x 100
is a valid perl expression. Perl is crazy enough
to work out that D is not an identifier, therefore must be
a char. It is a "bareword", and will cause warnings with -w

No 'seq' on *BSD, so I use `jot 9`

  |Awka is an open-source implementation                |
  |of the AWK programming language.                     |
  |                                                     |
  |Awka is not an interpreter like Gawk, Mawk or Nawk,  |
  |but instead it converts the program to ANSI-C,       |
  |then compiles this using gcc or a native C           |
  |compiler to create a binary executable.              |
  |This means you must have an ANSI C compiler          |
  |present on your system for Awka to work.             |

you are tying to solve the problem of
finding the hostname or host address of
the *local* host on the *remote* host.
there is an fundamental error in this!

anyway, i do not see a requirement for sed.
i do have some answers for you - but
none of these require sed in any way.
so let's take this off this list...

this is the part I like less :-(

I tried unsuccessfully to compile it with the
borland's free c++ compiler.

I suppose I am on the wrong lane, am I not?

Are there awka pre-compiled binaries for windows or, at
least some docs how to do it?

If you don't have "seq" you could use POSIX integer arithmetic:

((i=0))
while ((i<9)); do
	((i=i+1))
	print i is $i
done

the seq command can be emulated by a 2-line function


    BASH:

sek(){
 local o=+ a=1 z=${1:-1}; [ "$2" ] && { a=$1; z=$2; } ; [ $a -gt $z ]
&& o=-
 while [ $a -ne $z ]; do echo $a ; eval "a=\$((a$o 1))"; done; echo $a

try wrapping your loop in sub-shell parentheses:

time ( for i in *.txt ; do blah; blah; done )

Subject: timing scripts
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi all,
Actually this has to do more with shell than sed.
I want to time a shell script but am unable to do so.
I will be typing it on command prompt only and not as a seperate file.
I use this script to change words in a bunch of files like,
#for i in `ls *.txt`
>do
>sed 's/foo/bar/g' $i > temp
>mv temp $i
>done

I put this command on one line seperating it by ";"
How do I use timing for it? It does not take the command time before it
giving,
-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `do'

Thanks a lot in advance and bye.
With regards.

-Payal

No no. $(...) is process substitution, i.e. create a subshell,
exec a list of commands and return the resulting string to the
parent process.

This is redundant in our case. All we want to do is the
exec-in-subshell part. We aren't interested in getting the result
string back (though of course that works, too). Hence we just use
(...)

To quote "man sh":
    "and lastly, `( .. )' is used to create subshells."

Two points though: 
    * this is shell specific stuff (in my case zsh and BSD sh)
    * it is pretty OT for the sed list, so I'll shut up now...

Subject: How to pick up only stand-alone "ONE" and not anything like "NONE" nor "ONEWAY"
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

At first it looked easy. For example, I want to substitute any stand-alone
"ONE" by "TWO", I do:

sed 's/\([ 	]\)ONE\([ 	]\)/\1TWO\2/g'		# one space and one tab inside []

However, this doesn't pick up any stand-alone "ONE" at beginning or end of
line.
For example:

ONE IS GOOD
THIS ONE FOR YOU
I SAID NONE OF ABOVE
THIS IS ONEWAY STREET
HERE IS A GOOD ONE

Above sed script gave this output:

ONE IS GOOD
THIS TWO FOR YOU
I SAID NONE OF ABOVE
THIS IS ONEWAY STREET
HERE IS A GOOD ONE

But, I want it to be:

TWO IS GOOD
THIS TWO FOR YOU
I SAID NONE OF ABOVE
THIS IS ONEWAY STREET
HERE IS A GOOD TWO

How can I cover all situations for all stand-alone "ONE"?

Joe

Your regular expression is saying match on a single space. So, at the start 
of a line where there is no single space it fails.

You could match with [ ]* which matches zero or more spaces, but that won't 
help you differentiate between ONE and NONE.

I think you have no alternatives but to have two or maybe three tests

sed -e 's/\([ 	]\)ONE/\1TWO/g' -e 's/ONE([ 	]\)/TWO\1/g'

will get everything except a ONE that occurs on a line by itself.

Alternatively, you could use three tests guaranteed to get everything

sed -e 's/^ONE\([ 	]\)/TWO\1/' \
	-e 's/\([ 	]\)ONE$/\1TWO/' \
	-e 's/\([ 	]\)ONE\([ 	]\)/\1TWO\2/g'

Note that there's only a single "beginning and "end" to each line, so you 
don't need the g suffix.

Untested of course,
Angus

Subject: Extracting 'Received:'
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi Sedders!
I'm new here and have a question.

I have written a script to extract 'Received:' fields from a header
of an email saved in mBox format.

I've tested the script against two versions of sed running in Cygwin
enviroment:

$ sed --version
super-sed version 3.96
based on GNU sed version 3.02.80


$ sed_old --version
GNU sed version 4.0.1


In both cases the script did not return expected results.

The script looks like this (saved in jed.sed):

#v+
  /^Received:/{
  :foo
  h
  N
  /\n[ \t].*$/{
  b foo
  }
  g
  p
  }
#v-

and is invoked like this (jed.txt contains email message):

  $sed -n -fjed.sed jed.txt

It does not return any output. It's quite simple and I have no idea
what might be wrong.

My final goal is to *remove* these fields from an email message but
for now I just would like to have the above script working.


Thanks in advance for your comments.


Pozdrawiam,

Status:   

Hi Sedders!

[super-sed version 3.96, based on GNU sed version 3.02.80, Cygwin]

I have a working script, saved in file, which I'd like to be able
to enter in command line.

#v+
  /^Sender:/{a\
  Newsgroups: internal.ml.mingw-users
  p
  d
  }
  p
#v-

When I try to enter it I get an error message:

	sed: -e expression #1, char 0: Unmatched `{'
  
This is what I enter: 

sed -n -e"/^Sender:/{a\;Newsgroups: internal.ml.mingw-users;p;d};p" jed.txt

TIA

This seems complicated just to delete some lines.  I don't leave spaces
between the b and foo in my scripts.  Post an example of the data file
you are working with and what you want the output to be.

Subject: Upgrading a redhat system using sed(?!)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi!

I'm sure somebody would have encountered this before. What
I'm trying do is upgrading RedHat 7.2 to 8.0, by force
installing all the new RPMs from 8.0 on my 7.2 machine. I
got the list of RPMs, using rpm -qa and now, I want to strip
away the version info, so that I can use the package name to
install the newer RPM.

The output of rpm -qa looks like:

redhat-logos-1.1.3-1
glibc-2.2.4-13
cracklib-2.7-12
dosfstools-2.7-1
termcap-11.0.1-10

I want to strip away the version info, so that the above
looks like:

redhat-logos
glibc
cracklib
dosfstools
termcap

I tried with the following, to get the RPM name, without
success.

for i in `cat /tmp/INSTALLED_RPMS_7.2`
do
  RPM=`echo $i | sed 's/\W\(\w\)*$//;s/\(\w\.\)*$//'`;
  echo "$i -> $RPM";
done

One has to get the second last '-' from the end, and delete
from there till the end. Is this possible with sed at all?

Thanks,

chyrag.

PS: Well, there might be better ways to upgrade a RedHat
system, but the itch won't go away :)

It would be easier for me if you could show an example of the "Received" field and its subsequent lines in the email: that would save me some time looking it up.

Thanks & best wishes,

  I'm sorry about that. Here is a part of header from your email, I
  think it should be sufficient. Looking from the top in first
  'Received:' field subsequent lines start with tabs, in consequent
  fields they start with one or two spaces.

Hi all,
The first column in my file has the following shape: CTRL-000112-01. How can
I remove the -01 at the end of the numeric part without affecting the middle
one?

[strip "Received:" lines]

Thanks for the example: I could of course have looked at the mail headers myself, but somehow didn't think of it.  I guess "mBox" format threw me.  And it's been a hard day, honest!  ;-)

Anyway, this ought to do it, I think.

   Whatever follows the a (append) command within double-quotes is 
taken literally. This means that ssed "wants" to interpret the 
semicolons and the closing } as literal strings to print/append to 
the standard output, rather than as directives to separate internal 
sed script elements.

   To defeat this, add another -e on the command line:

     sed -n -e"/^Sender:/{a\;Newsgroups:blahblah" -e "p;d};p"

   However, I believe you can get the same results from a much 
simpler script. You don't need the -n switch or the braces, or the p 
or the d:

     sed "/^Sender:/a Newsgroups: internal.ml.mingw-users" jed.txt

   Note in particular that no backslash is needed at all after the a 
(append) command. A simple space will do.

HTH.

That will remove the -01 at the end of the _last_ column, not the first.

You need something like:

s/\([^[:space:]]*\)-01/\1/

or whatever.

I'm sure somebody would have encountered this before. What
I'm trying do is upgrading RedHat 7.2 to 8.0, by force
installing all the new RPMs from 8.0 on my 7.2 machine. I
got the list of RPMs, using rpm -qa and now, I want to strip
away the version info, so that I can use the package name to
install the newer RPM.

The output of rpm -qa looks like:

redhat-logos-1.1.3-1
glibc-2.2.4-13
cracklib-2.7-12
dosfstools-2.7-1
termcap-11.0.1-10

I want to strip away the version info, so that the above
looks like:

redhat-logos
glibc
cracklib
dosfstools
termcap

I tried with the following, to get the RPM name, without
success.

for i in `cat /tmp/INSTALLED_RPMS_7.2`
do
  RPM=`echo $i | sed 's/\W\(\w\)*$//;s/\(\w\.\)*$//'`;
  echo "$i -> $RPM";
done

One has to get the second last '-' from the end, and delete
from there till the end. Is this possible with sed at all?

Thanks,

chyrag.

PS: Well, there might be better ways to upgrade a RedHat
system, but the itch won't go away :)

This will not work with packages that have "-<some-digit>" 
in them. For eg. XFree86-100dpi-fonts and XFree86-75dpi-fonts
But I guess, there would be very few packages like that.

Thanks,

   That's a little bit better, but not quite satisfactory. The 
expression

      [^[:space:]]*

will match any non-space character zero or more times. So therefore, 
it also matches nothing. Be careful of those asterisks, and beware of 
including a zero-length match at the head of an expression. Observe:

---begin console output---

d:\4dos>>echo foo -01 bar-01
foo -01 bar-01

d:\4dos>>echo foo -01 bar-01 | sed "s/\([^[:space:]]*\)-01/\1/"
foo  bar-01

---end console output---

   Notice how that expression DID match the first "-01", even though 
it had a space character immediately before it. That's because the * 
means that a null match is allowed. In other words, it's functionally 
the same as writing this:

      sed "s/-01//"    # find the first match and delete it

   But since Hassan specified that he wanted a match "at the end of a 
numeric part" in the first column, this would be far safer:

      sed "s/\([0-9]\)-01/\1/"

Hope this helps.

I'm looking for those also! GNU sed is now up to version 4.0.3, and 
if anyone has compiled binaries for Win32, I'd like to post the 
compiled versions (with the GNU source code) on my web page also.  

Thanks in advance.

Just some more ideas.

Where is your client getting the ip number of that host name?
Could this be a misconfigured DNS or lmhosts file?

You should run smbclient with -d4 and see how the host name is being
resolved.

Is your network misconfigured? Which NIC on your server responds to
broadcast packets from your client?

Dear Alexandros,

Thanks for your help. This is a good solution, but the Unix flavors (SCO 5 and Sun OS 5.6) that I am using doesn't support 'tac'. Any more solutions?

turning the cat around twice
seems quite like overkill...
but i suppose there must be
50 ways to kill a "cat"..

how about using "vi"?

  vi -c '1,3d|$-2,$d|x' file

compare with the test below.
(and don't quote it in replies -
 edit your messages! thankyou).

and shouldn't this be possible with sed, too?
the range "$-2" does not seem to be allowed..

I thought about it and it is not possible to do it coherently:

/abc/ s/abc/def/
/def/-2,/def/+2 s/$/ changed/

which lines should be changed with this input?

1 xxx
2 yyy
3 abc
4 zzz
5 qqq

1..5 is not possible, sed should look into the future when processing line 1
and gather that it will substitute /abc/ on line 3 with /def/. None is not
coherent, why would replacing `-1' with `+1' replace lines 4..5?

The problem is that we are executing a stream of commands, not a single one!

What's wrong with it? It looks fine to me, it looks like well
written code although maybe you could cut down the number of
lines with some optimising tricks but why? The only inelegant
thing about that code is the walking/ragged indentation
which could be a little sidetracking if you're reading through
it, I'd reformat it a bit;

| /=$/{ s/=$//
|       :dl
|       N
|       s/=$//
|       t dl
|       s/\n//g
|     }
| s/=20/ /g
| s/=3D/=/g


Other suggestions are to add more characters to the conversion 
at the end because although SPACE and EQUALSIGN are the most common
TAB also occurs a lot, I would definently at least add that;

| s/=09/TAB/g

Where TAB is an actual TAB character rather than the letters T, A, B

Often I've seen the reason why posts get converted into quoted-printable
by newsreaders/e-mail clients is because of the presence of a single
solitary accented character. In order to get those with 100% accuracy
you also would need to know what character set they came from and
inspect the headers. Of course if you didn't want be that accurate
but still desire to convert ALL the quoted-printable escapes you could
just convert them without translation and adjust your file viewer
later for that purpose. AWK/PERL are both most suitable for such a purpose,
SED could do it with an exhaustive table but you'd probably use AWK/PERL
to generate that script anyway (and it may not be faster esp. than perl)

This one is slightly rewritten, it saves one substitution and

 Hubert Do/l/ega <hubert@rava.com.pl> wrote:Hi Sedders!
I'm new here and have a question.

I have written a script to extract 'Received:' fields from a header
of an email saved in mBox format.

I've tested the script against two versions of sed running in Cygwin
enviroment:

$ sed --version
super-sed version 3.96
based on GNU sed version 3.02.80


$ sed_old --version
GNU sed version 4.0.1


In both cases the script did not return expected results.

The script looks like this (saved in jed.sed):

#v+
  /^Received:/{
  :foo
  h
  N
  /\n[ \t].*$/{
  b foo
  }
  g
  p
  }
#v-

and is invoked like this (jed.txt contains email message):

  $sed -n -fjed.sed jed.txt

It does not return any output. It's quite simple and I have no idea
what might be wrong.

My final goal is to *remove* these fields from an email message but
for now I just would like to have the above script working.


Thanks in advance for your comments.

sed isn't the most convenient way to handle columns. cut, paste, and join
are better designed for column work.
You can handle columns with sed but you have to specify the column
separator. Give us an actual example and tell us the separator.

The generic instructions are:
Read in line.
Put 1 in first position in column followed by separator.
Match everything from the first position to the fourth separator.
Replace with all of the match and 1 0 0.

I think there should be one minor change to the syntax - there should be a
space after the '\11'
So it reads:
sed 's/^\([ ]*\)\([^ ]*\) \(.*\)/\11 \2 1 0 0 \3/g'  inputFile>output_file

   So the output file has 19 columns, right? It looks to me as if the 
files are TAB-delimited. So, I'd do this:

   sed "s/\t/&1\t0\t0\t/; s/^/1\t/" file >outfile

How it works: find the first tab, which marks the end of the first 
column. Then append "1\t0\t0\t" after it (the \t indicates a true tab 
character). Next, at the beginning of the line /^/, prefix it with a 
"1\t".  That's it.

If your version of sed doesn't support \t to indicate that TAB 
character, either (a) get ssed or GNU sed, which does, or (b) replace 
the \t escape sequence with a literal TAB in the script. HTH.

   Sed operates (as the experts already know) by applying all the 
lines of the script, in order, to each line of the input file. Take 
the whole script, and apply it to line #1. Then take the whole script 
and apply it to line #2. And so on.

   I think it would be possible to code it if the order of operation 
were reversed:

   Take the first line of the script, and apply it to all of the 
input file. Then take the 2nd line of the script, and apply it to all 
of the input file. And so forth.

   This would provide coherence, at the cost of reversing the way 
that sed processes the scripts currently. I think that's one possible 
solution.

   A second solution I can think of is to read the entire file into 
memory to start with, and do all the replacements in-place. Again, 
this would break the way that sed has always functioned, but it would 
allow for the backtracking required for negative addressing.

Subject: combining lines
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Status:   

Can anyone help me with this?

I have a pipe-delimited file with about 10,000 records. Some of the 
records (but not all)have a carriage return plus a '\', effectively 
giving me an extra line. 

atb|1.0.0.257|Vendor code for merchandise, picked up from inv table. 
^M\
sl_vendor = vendors.ve_id.|
atb|1.0.0.257|The ID number of the item sold. sl_seq = inv.inv_id3|
atb|1.0.0.257|The color (if applicable) of the line item; or the 
default ^M\
ASSORTED code if not. ^M\
sl_color = colors.col_code|


I am trying to remove the '^M\', which is easy enough, but I also 
need to re-join the line (or lines) created by the ^M\ to the line 
above it, since they are supposed to be a part of the same field. For 
the slice of data above, I should end up with 3 records (lines), each 
starting with 'atb|'.

This, of course may not produce the same set of results as for the
normal order and will not be of use where scripts make use of the n
or N commands.  Nor would any of the branching commands work.

But it does mess with the whole "line of input at a time" philosophy
of sed.  Essentially the proposed change (as Paolo points out) causes
sed's logic to break down.

In this case one might as well be passing the instructions to ex or ed
in a shell script or command line.  I suspect that this may be the real
reason that no one has implemented sed to cope with negative addressing
so far.

We should, perhaps, also note that neither awk, nor perl, nor ruby (all
of which contain features similar to those of sed) permits negative line
addressing per se.

i suppose this is about EOL conversion (yet again).
if you are using vim then it is really simple:

  :set fileformat=unix
  :write

or shorter:  :se ff=unix|w

please, this is really off topic here.
awk+sed questions and answers, please.

I have found a reference to it in sed&awk 2nd Edition, p. 98
where it says:

  /Northeast$/{
    s///
    w region.northeast
  }

  The substitute command matches the same pattern as the address
  and removes it.

I guess this is a pretty portable sed feature but I may be
wrong. I have used it as long as I do sed.

That can't work: sed is a stream editor and the stream may well be of an
indeterminate length, or even infinite. Assuming anything else would make
it have rather undesirable behaviour for a stream editor. If you want to
do non stream based editing tasks, use a different editor like ed or ex.
You can write a small shell script to simulate steram based behaviour.

eg:

#!/bin/bash

temptile=${TMP:-/tmp}/s-ed.$$.$RANDOM$RANDOM.tmp

cat > $tempfile

echo wq | cat $1 - | ed $tempfile

cat $tempfile

rm $tempfile

##

Obviously, you may want a rather more advanced script than that, but you
get the idea.

Oh, I agree.

   However, there have been instances in sed scripts (not recommended 
but they are there) where the entire input file is slurped up into 
the pattern space or the hold space, and then after the whole file is 
collected, the substitutions occur after that.

   I agree that this is a non-standard use of sed, and I'm not 
seriously recommending the idea of breaking sed's normal functioning. 
I'm just trying to think of ways to implement negative addressing.

   But as it was pointed out to me by several others, this would have 
bad consequences on things like N; and other common sed commands. I'm 
not going to advocate for revising sed's basic operation!!

It is portable with a few glitches:

1) It is not POSIX, so it is portable but not Portable.

2) GNU sed in POSIXLY_CORRECT mode will not do that (as well as ssed)

3) GNU sed 3.x executes the last *compiled* regexp, i.e. the previous regexp
in the script, while other GNU and non-GNU seds execute the last *executed*
regexp. So:

/X/ {
  :a
  s///
  /Y/ba
}

when given XYY will lock up with GNU sed 3.x.

OTOH some seds (including ssed and GNU sed 4.x, which is what I know best
about) use the case sensitivity of the last regexp as well:

s/X/Y/
s//Z/gi

will not change lowercase x's to Z's

Thanks for the full exploration and explanation of this feature.

The sed scripts which will show up the differences between using
the compiled and the executed regex are very unlikely for me but
thanks for pointing this out

Subject: sed FAQ nearly ready to be released
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I am about ready to release the next version of the
sed FAQ. I haven't gotten all the bugs hammered out
yet, and would like another pair of eyes on the text.

Its main distrib format will be in multi-part HTML,
and I'm tweaking a perl script to output it in one-part
HTML and plain, unvarnished ASCII text with change bars.

If you would like me to send you a ZIP file with the
HTML parts, the source, and the Perl script to massage
the text, just email me and ask:

   pemente[at]northpark[dot]edu

Do not, *DO NOT* release this version or post it anywhere.
It contains several things that need to be checked and
(more importantly), lists URLs that are currently invalid.
However, if you would like to help me clean it up or if
you're willing to work with me behind the scenes, just ask.

Kind regards,

Eric Pement

Hi all,
I want to join all the lines in that file. How can I do it? I can do it 
with only pairs of lines using,
sed 'N;s/\n/ /'
How can I do it for all lines?
I can do that easily through vi.
Thanks and bye.
With regards.

The canonical UNIX solution is to use tr to delete the newline
characters:

    tr -d '\n' <infile >outfile

or you could use it to replace the newlines with spaces, or
whatever.  man tr for options.

2. Common one-line sed scripts

   A separate document of over 70 handy "one-line" sed commands is
   available at <http://www.cornerstonemag.com/sed/sed1line.txt>. Here
   are fourteen of the most common sed commands for one-line use.
   MS-DOS users should replace single quotes ('...') with double
   quotes ("...") in these examples. A specific filename ("file")
   usually follows the script, though the input may also come via
   piping ("sort somefile | sed 'somescript'").

   # 1. Double space a file
   sed G file

   # 2. Triple space a file
   sed 'G;G' file

   # 3. Under UNIX: convert DOS newlines (CR/LF) to Unix format
   sed 's/.$//' file    # assumes that all lines end with CR/LF
   sed 's/^M$// file    # in bash/tcsh, press Ctrl-V then Ctrl-M

   # 4. Under DOS: convert Unix newlines (LF) to DOS format
   sed 's/$//' file                     # method 1
   sed -n p file                        # method 2

   # 5. Delete leading whitespace (spaces/tabs) from front of each line
   # (this aligns all text flush left). '^t' represents a true tab
   # character. Under bash or tcsh, press Ctrl-V then Ctrl-I.
   sed 's/^[ ^t]*//' file

   # 6. Delete trailing whitespace (spaces/tabs) from end of each line
   sed 's/[ ^t]*$//' file               # see note on '^t', above

   # 7. Delete BOTH leading and trailing whitespace from each line
   sed 's/^[ ^t]*//;s/[ ^]*$//' file    # see note on '^t', above

   # 8. Substitute "foo" with "bar" on each line
   sed 's/foo/bar/' file        # replaces only 1st instance in a line
   sed 's/foo/bar/4' file       # replaces only 4th instance in a line
   sed 's/foo/bar/g' file       # replaces ALL instances within a line

   # 9. Substitute "foo" with "bar" ONLY for lines which contain "baz"
   sed '/baz/s/foo/bar/g' file

   # 10. Delete all CONSECUTIVE blank lines from file except the first.
   # This method also deletes all blank lines from top and end of file.
   # (emulates "cat -s")
   sed '/./,/^$/!d' file       # this allows 0 blanks at top, 1 at EOF
   sed '/^$/N;/\n$/D' file     # this allows 1 blank at top, 0 at EOF

   # 11. Delete all leading blank lines at top of file (only).
   sed '/./,$!d' file

   # 12. Delete all trailing blank lines at end of file (only).
   sed -e :a -e '/^\n*$/N;/\n$/ba' file

   # 13. If a line ends with a backslash, join the next line to it.
   sed -e :a -e '/\\$/N; s/\\\n//; ta' file

   # 14. If a line begins with an equal sign, append it to the
   # previous line (and replace the "=" with a single space).
   sed -e :a -e '$!N;s/\n=/ /;ta' -e 'P;D' file

Hello all:

you can also run the following command:

  dos2unix infile outfile

If you do not want to change the name of your file you can
use the same name for both infile and outfile.

Another way to do it (it is not nice but just another alternative) is
to use pico editor if you have it. Just enter:

pico filename

then press Ctrl+ o followed by Ctrl+x

I hope this helps.

Subject: Repeating lines a number of times
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   


I have data similar to :

"Bread", 6, 5, 3, 4.6
"Cheese", 5, 3, 2, 5.6
"Milk", 3, 2, 1, 5.0

I want to repeat rows N number of times, where N is the fourth (say) comma delimited variable, giving:


"Bread", 6, 5, 3, 4.6
"Bread", 6, 5, 3, 4.6
"Bread", 6, 5, 3, 4.6
"Cheese", 5, 3, 2, 5.6
"Cheese", 5, 3, 2, 5.6
"Milk", 3, 2, 1, 5.0

Any ideas, anyone?

If by NUL you mean ascii of 0, I don't see why it wouldn't work.

You can search for any special character, with some versions of sed, using
x or o as the prefix for the hex or octal number for the character. Also,
the escape characters, \r \n, might also work.

Remove all the ^Ms using the following line:

tr -d '\r' < file-in > file-out

Thanks for the mails all of you. I like this as well as the easy tr
solution by Peter.
Can you please explain in brief the above command?

Thanks and bye.
With regards.

Yes. I just tried it.
cat file | sed "s/anystring/&\x0/"
puts an ascii nul after anystring.

Joel

P.S. I didn't mention escaping the "x" in my first post. I left that as an
excerise for the student.

awk is much better used for this than sed. Depending on the exact
format of your data file, it might be easier or more difficult to
parse. If the fields themselves does not contain any commas, you can
use the following

awk -F, '{ for(i=0; i<$4; i++) print $0 }'

(untested)

Sure.

   # This script slurps up the entire file at once, and then
   # does the substitution.

   :a;    # Define label a

   $!N;   # For all lines but the last one, add the Next

   s/\n / /g;   # Replace every newline with a single space.

Done.

If you want a pure sed solution, this works:

/^.*,.*,.*, 1/{p}
/^.*,.*,.*, 2/{p;p}
/^.*,.*,.*, 3/{p;p;p}    

sed -n -f scriptabove datafile

This might get clumsy for more than 10 or 20 repeats.

Subject: removing parens
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

hello,

here is something that seems simple to me but i can't figure it out.
i have a word in parentheses and i want to extract just the word.

a line from a log file:

fetchmail: Query status=2 (SOCKET)

i can get rid of the parens by brute force, one at a time, but that's
ugly.  i thought this would work but no joy:

sed -e 's/\((.*)\)/\1/'

the idea was to indicate literal parens on the outside & capture the
text with the inner group.  but i just get back the original
expression. 

i tried several variations on this theme, but obviously i'm
misunderstanding something important.  hopefully, someone can clear
this up for me.  

thanks.

mp

Is it safe to assume there is only one pair of parens on a line? If 
the answer is yes, then try this:

   sed 's/.*(//; s/).*//'

If this is not a safe assumption, then tell us what we may assume 
about the presence of parens on a line.

yes, that works perfectly.  i was originally isolating the (SOCKET)
and trying to work sed on it, but your solution is much more
efficient.  it goes to show, one should beware of being locked into
one way of doing things.  thanks very much.

How about:

$ echo "fetchmail: Query status=2 (SOCKET) other stuff" |
sed 's/.*(\([^)]*\)).*/\1/'

Subject: Get unique lines
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   


Hello,

  How can I get unique lines from a file using sed or gawk?  Lets say I have file below(sorry if it's double space, it should be single space):

Alarm-1-1-1  1 2 3 4

Alarm-1-1-2  1 2 3 4

Alarm-1-2-1  1 3 3 5

Alarm-1-2-2  1 3 3 4

Alarm-1-3-1  6 5 3 7

Alarm-1-3-2  6 5 3 7

 

Should give me the two lines below(sorry if it's double space, it should be single space):

Alarm-1-2-1  1 3 3 5

Alarm-1-2-2  1 3 3 4

 

Thanks,

Albert

I assume that the file is tab separated?  Otherwise, you could get it in
that form with a sed pass like

s/\(Alarm-.-.-.\)  \(.*\)/\1<tab>\2/

Then run an awk script like this:

awk -F'<tab>' '{
  # Remember the count for each line and the input.
  # If your input is very large, you might want to do a
  # "delete what[$2]" as soon as count[$2] > 1.
  count[$2]++;
  what[$2] = $0;
}

END {
  # Print unique elements
  for (i in count)
    if (count[i] == 1) print what[i];
}'

If the input file is sorted, the script can be optimized not to slurp the
entire input file before outputting values, like

awk -F'<tab>' '{
  if (last_2 != $2)
     {
        # Found a new item, print the last one if unique
        if (dup == 0)
          print last
        else
          dup = 0
       }
  else
    # Found same item, remember not to print them
    dup++;

  last = $0
  last_2 = $2
}

END {
  # If last item was unique, print it
  if (dup == 0) print last
}'

(Both scripts untested).

Hello,

if the first parameter is not relevant (otherwise all is uniq) and there are
no newlines (otherwise delete it with sed -n "/^.$/p" ) then it may be
help a awk-Script like this:

#Find uniq lines from Position 2 to end of Line
#Input like:
#Alarm-1-1-1  1 2 3 4

BEGIN {FS=" "; old1=""; old2="";}

{$1=""; 
if ((old1!=$0) && (old2!=old1)) print old1;
old2=old1;
old1=$0;
}

END {if (old1!=$0) print $0; }

Good new Year 2003 !

I would use uniq and sort for
this sort of job. sed and awk just aren't designed for it.
For example, this works:
sort  +1 -u junk   
This won't work if there are extra blanks at the end of a line, but you get
the idea.

> How can I get unique lines from a file using sed or gawk?

   This is a one-line script in sed or gawk. Change the 'single quotes'
to "double quotes" if you are using a DOS/Windows version of sed/awk.

SED SOLUTION:

  # The duplicate lines are consecutive (one after another)
  sed '$!N; /^\(.*\)\n\1$/!P; D'

  # The duplicate lines are NOT consecutive (can appear anywhere)
  sed -n 'G; s/\n/&&/; /^\([ -~]*\n\).*\n\1/d; s/\n//; h; P'

AWK SOLUTION:

   # The duplicate lines are consecutive
   awk 'a !~ $0;{a=$0}'

   # The duplicate lines are NOT consecutive
   awk '! a[$0]++'                     # most concise script
   awk '!($0 in a) {a[$0];print}'      # most efficient script

These scripts appear in my sed one-liners file, and the awk script
on the bottom appears in my awk one-liners file. Hope this helps,
and let me know if it doesn't!

All seders,

I issue the command:
ps -u hlisys | grep java

and get :

  204 14054      -  0:00 java
  204 14992      -  0:01 java
  204 22772      -  0:01 java

  204 29918      -  0:00 java

In a generic form, you can use:  

ps -u hlisys | sed -n '/hlisys/s/\(hlisys [^/]*\) .* \(Hekimian[^ ][^ ]*\).*/\1 \2/p'

And it will print : 

hlisys 29918 26368   0 12:08:02      -  0:00 Hekimian.Messenger.ExternalMessengerServer
  hlisys 35310 26368   0 12:08:38      -  0:01 Hekimian.CenterOp.AutodiscoveryLoader.CenterOpParser

But, if you have a list of "well known" instance names, you can be more accurate ...

ps -u hlisys | sed -n '/hlisys/{
s/\(hlisys [^/]*\) .* Hekimian[^ ][^ ]*\(ExternalMessengerServer\)[^ ]*.*/\1 \2/p
s/\(hlisys [^/]*\) .* Hekimian[^ ][^ ]*\(AutodiscoveryLoader\)[^ ]*.*/\1 \2/p
}
'
Which will print :
hlisys 29918 26368   0 12:08:02      -  0:00 ExternalMessengerServer
  hlisys 35310 26368   0 12:08:38      -  0:01 AutodiscoveryLoader


Good look and happy new year !

 Michael Powe <michael@trollope.org> wrote:hello,

here is something that seems simple to me but i can't figure it out.
i have a word in parentheses and i want to extract just the word.

a line from a log file:

fetchmail: Query status=2 (SOCKET)

i can get rid of the parens by brute force, one at a time, but that's
ugly.  i thought this would work but no joy:

sed -e 's/\((.*)\)/\1/'

the idea was to indicate literal parens on the outside & capture the
text with the inner group.  but i just get back the original
expression. 

i tried several variations on this theme, but obviously i'm
misunderstanding something important.  hopefully, someone can clear
this up for me.  

thanks.

Hello,
   Happy New Year to all.
   Thanks for your responses but so far nothing worked?  From my example below, I want to print the unique lines from a file if  columns 1,2,3,5,6,7,8(without column 4; taking "-" and tab as separators).  When I print the unique lines, it must include column 4.
Alarm-1-1-1  1 2 3 4
Alarm-1-1-2  1 2 3 4
Alarm-1-2-1  1 3 3 5
Alarm-1-2-2  1 3 3 4
Alarm-1-3-1  6 5 3 7
Alarm-1-3-2  6 5 3 7



Should give me the two lines below because they have different last column:

Alarm-1-2-1  1 3 3 5
Alarm-1-2-2  1 3 3 4


Sorry if you misunderstood my previous email:-(
Albert

Hello guys,
Sorry again if I confused everyone:-(  It should compare first if column 1-3 are same, then compare all its columns except column4 if same.  If not same, print the whole lines.  If all same, don't print anything.  
Anyway, I just made this script to get what I want(made the tab to space in the input).  Any suggestion to improve this with just sed or awk, the better.  I really appreciate it.
***
#!/bin/ksh
gawk -F"[-| ]" '/^Alarm/{
  print $1"-"$2"-"$3"\t"$5"\t"$6"\t"$7"\t"$8
}' $1 | sort | uniq -u | cut -f1-5 | uniq | \
gawk -v sq="'" '{
      print "gawk " sq "/" $1 "/ && /" $2 " " $3 " " $4 " " $5 "/" sq " '"$1"' "
}' | ksh

Hello,

By the way, my real input data could look something like this: 

quark:/export/home/albert/tmp(309)> cat test2
Alarm-1-1-1 1 2 3 4
Alarm-1-1-1 4 5 6 7
Alarm-1-1-1 8 9 0 1
Alarm-1-1-2 1 2 3 4
Alarm-1-1-2 4 5 6 7
Alarm-1-1-2 8 9 0 1 
Alarm-1-2-1 1 3 3 5
Alarm-1-2-2 1 3 3 4
Alarm-1-3-1 2 3 4 5
Alarm-1-3-1 6 5 3 7
Alarm-1-3-2 2 3 4 5
Alarm-1-3-2 6 5 3 7

One thing I missed, it should compare cols 1-3, then every corresponding value of column 4(1 &2), must have exact match of column 5 to end of column.  If no match, prints it. If match, do nothing.

Example:
Alarm-1-1-1 1 2 3 4  should match  Alarm-1-1-2 1 2 3 4
Alarm-1-1-1 4 5 6 7  should match  Alarm-1-1-2 4 5 6 7


My previous script posted will still print:
Alarm-1-2-1 1 3 3 5
Alarm-1-2-2 1 3 3 4


Thanks.

Hello guys,
Sorry again if I confused everyone:-(  It should compare first if column 1-3 are same, then compare all its columns except column4 if same.  If not same, print the whole lines.  If all same, don't print anything.  
Anyway, I just made this script to get what I want(made the tab to space in the input).  Any suggestion to improve this with just sed or awk, the better.  I really appreciate it.

Did you find out why?  I did not exactly understand the
operation of your previous script.

   After you explained it a second time, I realized that what
you want are FULLY unique lines. You didn't just want dupes
removed, you wanted to print the line only if the line had
never been repeated anywhere in the file (understanding that
the match criteria excludes the 4th field).

   I was a bit amazed at your overly long script. If I ever
have to use more than 3 pipes, I usually suspect something
must be wrong. I believe that I have solved your issue in
a single awk script. It uses two hashes. One hash keeps a
count of how many times a line has been seen (with the "line"
defined as every field but the 4th field). The other hash
saves the entire line, including the 4th field. The script
seems to work on the small sample you provided.

   Note that by virtue of the way hashes are stored, the
values are not sorted when they are returned. If you want
the values sorted when the script executes, you'll have to
add that function. Anyway, try this:

  #---begin GNU awk script---
  BEGIN { FS = "[ \t-]" }
  {
    a = $1 $2 $3 $5 $6 $7 $8  # convert fields to string
    ++hash1[a]                # count how often string occurs
    hash2[a] = $0             # save original line
  }
  END {                       # print only if seen one time
    for (var in hash1)
      if (hash1[var] == 1)
        print hash2[var]
  }
  #---end of awk script---

Finally, this is a sed group. I think your problem is doable in
sed, but I don't care to expend the mental energy right now. HTH.

Here's a solution in sed. Apart from the ^ at the beginning of a [...]
group, a pair such as ^A refers to ASCII 1, etc. In the line below the one
marked with a --- I think you'll have to replace the spaces with tabs.




#######################################################################################
#Create the key and the line so we have:
#^Dkey^Eline
s/.*/^D&^F&/

#Remove the number in col 4 to make the key the key ---
s/-[0-9] / /

#Prepend the key,line to the hold space
x
H
x

#The hold space has the following format:
#^Akey^Bn^Cline
#n is 1 if one instance of the key exist and 2 if more exist.

tt
:t

#Attempt to substitute ^Dkey...^Akey^Bn^C...\n for ...^Akey^B2^C
#Since this is at least the second occurance, the line can be removed
#since it won't be displayed.
s/^D\(.*\)^F[^\n]*\n\(.*\)^A\1^B[12]^C[^\n]*\n/\2^A\1^B2^C/
te

#If that failed, then this is a new key, so enter the new key:
s/^D\(.*\)^F\([^\n]*\)/^A\1^B1^C\2/

:e
#On the last line of input, print the results.
${
        s/^A[^^C]*^C//g
        p
}

x
d

Here's the uncommented script. Its suprisingly short:

s/.*/^D&^F&/
s/-[0-9] / /

Hi,
In one of the material I was reading about sed mentioned,

/^+*/  --> matches line starting with plus sign and followed by atleast
	   one space.
/^*/   --> any squence of spaces at begining of line.

Is this right? I think /^+*/ maches a line starting with atleast one
instance of "+"
What does the second expression given above mean?

Thanks and bye.
With regards.

no.  there are no spaces in your patterns involved at all.

not quite.  it matches *all* lines which
start with *zero* or more plus signs.
so it actually matches *all* lines because
*all* lines start with *zero* <whatever>.

> What does the second expression given above mean?
> /^*/

all lines starting with an asterisk.

usually, the characters '*' and '+'
are group operators.  but if there
is nothing before them then they
are simply normal characters.

as for the spaces stuff - maybe
you mean these patterns:

/^ */
/^ +/

go figure them out for yourself.
so some tests.  describe them.
and also describe the results.
you'll learn a lot by doing so.

HI Payal, 
the second expression /^*/ means 
^ denotes start of line 
* denotes any character 
Hope this helps, 
Priti.

Is this right? I think /^+*/ maches a line starting with atleast one

What does the second expression given above mean?

Thanks and bye.

I guess the pages were formatted in different way and my viewer was
unable to show them properly. For a while I was scared.

I guess this would mean,

/^ +/    any line starting with one or more spaces

Subject: some more basic sed questions
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi,
I am trying to get some rudimentary knowledge reading "Sed and
Awk" and some documents. I have some questions on it.

1. As a exercise I am trying to convert all,
<h1> to <H1>
<h2> to <H2>
<h3> to <H3> etc.

In my foo.sed file I use seperate substitution for each.
e.g
s/<h1>/<H1>/
s/<h2>/<H2>/
s/<h3>/<H3>/ etc.

How to do it *exactly* in one command? Is it possible?

2. Can anyone please explain this,
sed  's/\(.*\):\(.*\)/\2:\1/' test1

I have not got the whole idea of this. What do .* represent *exactly*?
Also why are 2 and 1 escaped by "\" ? I read about this 3-4 times but I
am not getting the idea.

I also haven't got the idea of "&" in sed.

Thanks a lot in advance and thanks for the time.
With regards.
-Payal

s/<h\([1-9]\)>/<H\1>/
You can convert the </h1> etc as well with:
s/\(<\/*\)h\([1-9]\)>/\1H\2>/g

.* means zero or more occurences of any character.
If you put a regex inside of \( and \) then you can recall what's inside
with \1 \2 etc.
Your example changes ie. first:second to second:first.

& will insert the whole part that matched.

I hope I was clear.

This does it:
sed 's/<h\([123]>\)/<H\1/g' test.txt

\(..\) saves the match so that you can use it again in the replacement.
If we wanted to retrieve <h, then this: \(<h\) would mean it could be 
retrieved as \1 and we'd have to retrieve the second part as \2.

[123] matches an occurence of 1 or 2 or 3. We save that and retrieve it in 
the replacement.

Normally sed will match the first occurence in the pattern space only. The g 
suffix tells it to match all such occurences.

Ok, I think that I've explained the \1, \2 parts of the replacement part. So 
what's been saved?

\(.*\): matches everying before ':'. It's retrieved with \1.
:(.*\) mathes everything after the colon.

So, the script replaces 
	some:text
with
	text:some

Ok? As for .* It means match zero or more instances of any character.

> I also haven't got the idea of "&" in sed.

You mean "match expression 1 AND expression 2?
/RE1/{
/RE2/some operation
}

once you start thinking this way
you'll take more heed about the

Well can you provide an alternative way of changing 'some:text' to 
'text:some'?

I have a problem of my own that I was about to post to the list. My sed 
commands also suffer from this greediness, but I'd like to resolve my own 
problem first. Here it is:

I have a little shell function that checks whether the users PATH variable 
needs augmenting and then does so.  I've been checking it out with 'route' 
and 'bcheckrc' which illustrate my problem.

$ whereis bcheckrc route
bcheckrc: /sbin/bcheckrc
route: /sbin/route /usr/sbin/route

The idea is that, in both cases, I should append '/sbin' to the PATH if it 
isn't there already. 'route' is found in multiple locations so I can discard 
the second one.

The relevant part of the script is below. I have this ugly if-block.
	if (echo $EXE | grep ' ' > /dev/null); then
		# Multiple executables
		# extract the first PATH element and discard any subsequent ones.
		PATHELEM=`echo $EXE | sed "s,\(.*\)/$1 .*,\1,"`
	else
		# A single executable only
		# extract the PATH element.
		PATHELEM=`echo $EXE | sed "s,\(.*\)/$1.*,\1,"`
	fi

The two sed commands differ by a single ' ' after $1. Is it not possible to 
collapse them to a single sed command and so get rid of the if-block? 

Any ideas?
Angus

Doh

    I am sure that Payal is referring to & when used in the
right-hand-side of a substitution, as in

.   s/find/& and replace/

    The & represents everything that matched in the FIND portion
of the s/// command. When the & is used in a replacement, the
pattern on the left-hand-side is repeated each time the & is used.
Thus:

.   s/boo/&&/;   # changes "boo" into "booboo", and also
.                # changes "boolean" into "booboolean"

   The & is more useful when the FIND portion is complex or cannot
be expressed as a string. For example,

.   s/^ *[A-Ma-m][c-p]\{2,5\}/[&]/

will put square brackets around the pattern that matched on the
left-hand-side of the s/// command. HTH.

Subject: delimiting a file with varying number of fields
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

sorry about the subject line, i just can't quite think how to word it.

i'll cut right to the chase here.

i want THIS data:
1979 Cadillac Eldorado 9.8 17.9
1992 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 6.7 15.2
1995 Ferrari 456 GT 5.1 13.4
1994 Ford Mustang GT 6.7 15.1
1995 Ford Thunderbird SC 7.0 15.2
1995 Geo Metro LSi Conv 12.7 18.8

to look like THIS:
1979	Cadillac	 Eldorado			9.8	17.9
1992	Chevrolet	 Camaro	Z28		6.7	15.2
1995	Ferrari	 456		GT		5.1	13.4
1994	Ford		 Mustang	GT		6.7	15.1
1995	Ford		 T-Bird	SC		7.0	15.2
1995	Geo		 Metro	LSi Conv	12.7	18.8

now, i can do something simple like just replacing spaces with tabs, but
that won't *quite* do what i want, due to the varying number of "trim"
descriptions.

basically, the data looks like this:
columns 1, 2 and 3 will ALWAYS == year, make and model, respectively.
the LAST two columns will ALWAYS == 0-60 and 1/4 mile time,
respectively.
however, the remaining fields will vary.  some cars have NO trim level,
some have ONE, some have TWO, etc.

let's see if i can work an actual question in here:
how can i write an expression that will substitute ONLY the 1st, 2nd,
3rd, last and next-to-last spaces with tabs?

always happy to clarify,
-ian

You could use :

/<h[0-9]>/y/h/H/

2. nothing different about already explained
3. nothing different about already explained

I recommend you use /^aa*/ to match at least one 'a' at begining, instead /^a+/, because some versons of sed will require that '+' would be "scaped" ( /^a\+ ). 

For example, to explain :

grep, sed, vim? ( vi or vim ) need to be escaped ( \+ instead only + )
'egrep -e', awk, don't

Sure, let me break it into multiple lines:
s/
\(<\/*\)   \1 will be  < with zero or more / ,escape the / with \
h
\([1-9]\)   \2 will be any single digit
>           the closing > of the html tag
/\1H\2>/    
g           do it for the whole line (global)

Upon closer inspection, it could be better as:
s/\(<\/*\)h\([1-9]>\)/\1H\2/g

  I would recommend against this. I do web programming for a living,
and most <Hn>...</Hn> tags enclose heading text strings, like so
(ignore the leading period: it's there to overcome yahoo's
problem of truncating leading spaces in display):

.     <h1>Through the Challenge</h1>

But this script would alter the output to read:

.     <H1>THrougH tHe CHallenge</H1>


In HTML 4.0, only 4 tags begin with H: <Hn>, <HEAD>, <HR>, and
of course <HTML>. You also want to account for the closing tags,
which are </Hn>, </HEAD>, etc. To set HTML opening and closing
tags to solid caps (without capitalizing any attributes which
may be inside them), I would do this using ssed (super-sed):

.     sed -R "s|</?h[a-z]*|\U&|g" input.htm > output.htm

Broken down, that looks like this:

.   -R        use Perl-style regexes in s/// commands
.   s|||      works just like s///

. FIND PORTION:
.   <      - literal left angle bracket
.   /?     - followed by 0 or 1 slash (ie, slash is optional)
.   h      - followed by literal lowercase 'h'
.  [a-z]*  - followed by 0 or more lowercase letters

. REPLACE PORTION:
.   \U     - uppercase next string (make all caps)
.   &      - whatever matched in the FIND portion

.  s|||g  - global replacement (replace all matches on a line)

I'm recommending that sed users and anyone who wants to consider
themselves power users should add ssed to their toolbox. In my
case, the default "sed.exe" on my Win98 and Win2000 computers
is really ssed (super-sed). HTH.

 Ian T <iterry@sdf.lonestar.org> wrote:sorry about the subject line, i just can't quite think how to word it.

i'll cut right to the chase here.

i want THIS data:
1979 Cadillac Eldorado 9.8 17.9
1992 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 6.7 15.2
1995 Ferrari 456 GT 5.1 13.4
1994 Ford Mustang GT 6.7 15.1
1995 Ford Thunderbird SC 7.0 15.2
1995 Geo Metro LSi Conv 12.7 18.8

to look like THIS:
1979      Cadillac      Eldorado                  9.8      17.9
1992      Chevrolet      Camaro      Z28            6.7      15.2
1995      Ferrari      456            GT            5.1      13.4
1994      Ford            Mustang      GT            6.7      15.1
1995      Ford            T-Bird      SC            7.0      15.2
1995      Geo            Metro      LSi Conv      12.7      18.8

now, i can do something simple like just replacing spaces with tabs, but
that won't *quite* do what i want, due to the varying number of "trim"
descriptions.

basically, the data looks like this:
columns 1, 2 and 3 will ALWAYS == year, make and model, respectively.
the LAST two columns will ALWAYS == 0-60 and 1/4 mile time,
respectively.
however, the remaining fields will vary.  some cars have NO trim level,
some have ONE, some have TWO, etc.

let's see if i can work an actual question in here:
how can i write an expression that will substitute ONLY the 1st, 2nd,
3rd, last and next-to-last spaces with tabs?

always happy to clarify,
-ian

This works for your first line.

s/^.*mailto://
s/\".*//
p
x
s/^[^>]*>//
s/<.*$//
p
s/.*/\"&\"/
p
x
s/.*/<&>/

Run as sed -n -f scriptabove datafile


1. Put line into hold space
2. remove up to mailto:
3. remove " and all beyond it
4. print it
5. Exchange with hold space (get original line back)
6. Remove everything up to the first >
7. Remove everthing after the first <, including <
8. print it
9. Put quotes around it
10. print it
11. Exchange with old space, getting back the email address
12. Put brackets around it
13. Print it.
14. Exchange with hold space
15. Append hold space to pattern space
16. Remove the embedded newline from step 34.
17. print it.

Piece of cake.

how about viewing the file with a web browser
and saving the "page" as "text"?  works for me.

   This is not only inefficient, it is seriously prone to error.
Inefficient, because a mailto: link MUST be preceded by a space,
tab, or newline; and MUST always be followed by at least six
characters, e.g., "mailto:a@b.au"). Since '.*' matches 0 characters,
there's no need to consider this eventuality, and the dot causes
too much backtracking.

   It is also prone to error, because multiple mailto: tags can
be found on a line, and \(.*\) will grab ALL of them; because
the string "> assumes that mailto: links are followed by double
quotes, when they can be surrounded by 'single quotes' instead;
and because the string "> assumes that <a href...> hyperlinks
do not use CLASS or ID or STYLE attributes within them. I would
replace

.        mailto:\(.*\)">

with

.        mailto:\([^'"]\{6,\}\)['"]

(note that it omits the trailing angle bracket), and then revise
the s/// command to handle multiple mailto: commands on one line,
which sometimes happens. HTML can have single lines thousands of
characters long, so this factor should be considered also.

   I don't have time right now to revise the s/// command, so
I leave that as an exercise to the reader. Thanks for listening.

Wow Eric, that was quite a post! 

In fact, it inspired me to try and write a safe script to do the job. I'm not 
sure I succeeded, but I had a pretty good go. FWIW, I append the resulting 
shell script.

Now I have a question of my own about your magic
	mailto:\([^'"]\{6,\}\)['"]
It works here on a plain old vanilla sed but I haven't come across \{6,\} 
before. I can see what it does here:
	"take at least 6 chars that aren't ['"]"

but could you explain the syntax in a little more detail? It isn't described 
in my man pages or in my "Unix in a nutshell" book.

Regards,
Angus

As in "gawk -F ' ' '{ print $1 }'", all I want to do is delete the
first column with sed 3.02.  How is it done?  The data will have
all forms of characters.  I am expecting the need to escape some
of the characters.

In awk, { print $1 } prints the first column: it doesn't delete it.

I always get a little confused when people talk about columns.  Do you mean you want to delete everything up to and including the first group of spaces?

Something like 's/^[^ ]* *//' perhaps?  Or have I got the wrong idea?

But surely you'll get this message if I only reply to the sed-users group, because you're subscribed to it?

Best wishes,
Stew

Also in gawk, the string "-F ' '" is superfluous, since this
is the default behavior of GNU awk. But maybe SoloCDM was just
letting us know that he wasn't going to change any defaults.

   If he wants to follow gawk, I suspect he wants to remove any
leading whitespace, and then the first group of consecutive
visible characters, followed by the next group of consecutive
whitespace.

   Your example used the *, when it should have used \+ to
mean one or more. Here is what I think fulfills the request,
using GNU sed 3.02 or higher, where "\t" = TAB, and "+" = \{1,\}.

.     sed -r 's/^[ \t]*[^ \t]+[ \t]+//' file

   The requester could also use awk to do the same thing:

.     awk '{$1=""; sub(/^[ \t]+/, ""); print}' file

HTH.

yes - that's why subscription to this list is required for posting.

of course you can subscribe to this list without getting all mails -
so you can just follow the group by reading the archive.

but posting wihtout subscription is not allowed.  feature.
and it's not negotiable.

Subject: SED to replace a paragraph
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi,

I am new to this list and to SED - I hope some of you could help me. I am busy writing an NT batch script that would update INI files on all the computers in our office based on some strings that I want to predefine. The "ini" files are standard "ini" files with sections marked with brackets, i.e.:

[section_1]
Dir1=c:\temp
Dir2=c:\winnt
[section_2]
startup=yes

etc.

I am pretty new to "sed". What I want to be able to do is include "sed" in my script that will look for a section ([section_1]) in all the ini files I'll define ahead of time, and replace that section with a section I'll have in an external file. What I actually want to do is update the paths. I know how to do a search and replace for one-liners but I cannot use a regular search and replace here because all the "ini" files have different paths in that section. To make things harder, that section is not at the same line or the same placement in all "ini" files. 
I know I can display it like this:

sed -n "/[section_1]/,/[section_2]/p myfile.ini

but that includes "[section_2]" in the output.

I'd like to have another file, an external file, something like:

[section_1]
Dir1=c:\recycle
Dir2=d:\temp
....
Dir30=d:\winnt

and just replace that whole section. Some "ini" files have that section with just 1 line and some have it with 50 lines - which is why I want to replace it by section and not by a line pattern. A section starts with an open bracket ("[") and ends with an open bracket - but doesn't include that last open bracket. I'd like to tell it to search for the pattern of "[section_1" and when it comes to another "[" end the search and that will define the block I want to search and replace. I only know how to search and replace a line, but not a paragraph - or a block like this.

I'd like to tell the script that when it finds that block, it should delete it and then add to the end of the file the new data from my other file. I don't really need to put it at the end of the file - it can be where the previous section was - I just thought it would be easier.

Furthermore, I would like to write in my script that if it cannot find a block that starts with "[section_1" then it should add the new data to the end of the file regardless.

Can you tell me how to do that? I'd really appreciate it.
If you can't, could you point me to where I can find out how to do that?

I have a set of GNU tools for NT's shell which include "sed", "gawk" and I just downloaded "awk" too. If it's easier with "awk" or "gawk", I might be interested in hearing that too.

Periodically I will need to update the paths in the "ini" files - which is why I prefer not to do this manually.

Thank you for taking the time.

Dani.

You  are usually better off with cut for removing columns.
With sed, to remove a column, decide what the column separator is. Assume
it is a tab.  Then something like this might work:

cat file | sed "s/^[^\t]*\t//"   

For the 2nd column,
cat file | sed "s/^\([^\t]*\t\)\([^\t]\t\)/\1/"

For the 3rd column,
cat file | sed "s/^\([^\t]*\t\)\([^\t]*\t\)\([^\t]*\t\)/\1\2/" 

This gets old fast.


This isn't as easy as:
cat file | cut -f2,3,4 etc

Subject: Re: SED to replace a paragraph
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

One liners just confuse more than help. They mainly server to dazzle the
newbies......

Anyway, I would try two passes.
Here is how I would approach it:
1. Search for [section_1]
2. Replace it with something easy, like REPLACE SECTION1
3. Delete everything up to [section_2]
Then, pipe this file into a 2nd sed script that:
1. Reads up to REPLACE SECTION1
2. Deletes REPLACE SECTION1
3. reads in the new file.

For example:
script1:

s/\[section_1]/REPLACE SECTION1/p <--Find section1, replace it and print
 tloop     <---If successful replace, jump to :loop
 p         <--If not successful replace, print pattern space 
 b         <--Go to end of script, read new line
:loop
 n         <--Read in new line to pattern space
 s/\[section_2]/&/  <---Test if section_2
 tdone              <---Section 2? If yes, go to :done
 bloop              <---If not section 2, loop back to :loop
:done
 p                  <---Print pattern space


script2:

s/REPLACE SECTION1// <--Look for and replace REPLACE
 treplace             <--If successful, go to :replace
 b                    <--Go to end of script, read new line,etc
:replace
rNewIniSectionFile   <--Read file and send to standard output

Run this command line:

sed -n -f script1 File.ini | sed -f script2

This isn't pretty but it works. The point is, knowing a few tricks like
looping and decision making with s, t, and b, allows you to solve by brute
forces many vexing problems.

Beware that the r (read command) is odd. It doesn't allow editing of the
file in the pattern space, it just sends the file to standard output after
the matched line.

I tried to use the hold space to avoid running this through a second script,
but I just couldn't make it work with the read command.

well - *none* of your "entries" are *followed* by "abc".
so there's is nothing to do here.

besides, i'm almost certain that you
mean a sequence of eight *digits*.
after all, do you know how many integers there
are in "0815"?  one, two, three, or four?

so i suppose that you want to
replace all eight-digit-sequences
which come not right after "abc"?

Or one line less:

/\[Section_2\]/!d
}
$r ReplacementFileSegment.ini

It's a good thing that you don't mind that the replacement goes at the end ;-)

Hello Ajay.
This should do the trick:

/abc[0-9]\{8\}/!s/\([a-zA-Z]\{3\}\)[0-9]\{8\}/\1XXXXXXXX/

Explanation: if the pattern space does not contain the RE, then do the 
substitution.

The RE /abc[0-9]\{8\}/ matches a string abc followed by exactly 8 digits.
The RE [a-zA-Z]\{3\}\) matches a string of any 3 letters. This is stored 
(wrapped inside \( \)) for later retrieval as \1
The RE [0-9]\{8\} matches a list of 8 digits. It is replaced by XXXXXXXX.

Regards,
Angus

Subject: appending a to a line via sed
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hello All,

I'm trying to find a way, via sed, to append something to the end of a line.  Something to the effect of finding PATH on a line, maybe using ^PATH to find it, and then appending ":/usr/test/bin" to the end.

Thanks,

Rich

Try this:
sed 's,^PATH.*,&:/usr/test/bin,' your_file

s,,, is an alternative to s/// and allows you to specify '/' in you 
replacement string easily. '&' references the entire matching expression.

[snip scripts]

The advantage of Joel's approach over Steve's is that you can read in the 
replacement at the same place in the file. You could however combine the two 
approaches:

# sed1
# Pass 1. Delete everything between Section_1 and Section_2 but leave the
# titles untouched.
/\[Section_1\]/,/\[Section_2\]/ {
/\[Section_1\]/!{
/\[Section_2\]/!d
}
}

# sed2
# Pass 2. Read in the replacement to Section_1 and delete the Section_1 title.
/\[Section_1\]/ {
r replacement.ini
d
}

Use it as:
$ sed -f sed1 your_input | sed -f sed2 > your_output

I, like Joel, have been unable to do this in a single script because 'r' does 
not right to the pattern space but below it. Thus, by the time you've read 
'Section_2', it's too late. At least, I've been unable to do otherwise.

Angus

Subject: replace first character
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi,
In a file I want to *replace* the first character of any line by @. I
don't want to just add @ in front of everyline, i want to replace the first
character with @.
I am unable to do so. It sounds so easy. Actually, I was interested to
do this in vi, but then tried to do it in sed without much success.

With regards.

How about
  cat file | sed -e 's/^./@/' -e 's/^$/@/'
?
If you don't want to have empty lines become @ also, leave off the second -e.

Cheerio,

Thanks for the answer. I forgot about the "."
I tried s/^*// but it didn't work.

Back to studying regular expressions.

I use sed all the time in vi. It is one of the big advantages of using vi,
as far as I am concerned.

For example, to do this in vi:
:1,$ ! sed "s/./@/"
If it messes up, just press "u" to undo.
To only do once section of your document, use line numbers or use the visual
mode (v) to paint the desired section, then do : ! sed etc.

Subject: Re: SED to replace a paragraph
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I really enjoy this group because it gives me some real world
excercises.  I have used awk for about 15 years and only read sed
scripts in others' work.  I have started using sed for a couple months
now and kick myself for ignoring it for so long.
I like the practice this group gives me and I hope to help some people
out.

Now back to our thread:

I have all but the *no section is in the file* part.  This will put the
new section in the same place as the old.  It also makes no assumtion as
to the name of the following section.

/\[Section 1\]/,/\[/{          #The address of the block to replace
/\[Section 1\]/{               #The address of the first line is used
to...
s///                           #...remove the first line...
rReplacementFileSegment.ini    #...and read in the file
}
/^\[/!d                        #Delete everything else in the block (up
to the start
                               #of the next section)
}

Trying to do a task in the most efficient way could be used to teach
newbies.  I think one-liners have their place when learning sed.  If
people are not shown that something can be done without a lot of bloat
then bloat will become the norm.
Not all tasks are worth the effort of tweaking the code but we should
spent the extra time while we're learning.

P.S. Yahoo seems to be really slow with mail lately.

I want to replace the string which has only 8 integers and it is not

so on the above case only xyzmno11122002 should be replaced with
xyzmnoXXXXXXXX

I want to replace the string which has only 8 integers and it is not

so on the above case only xyzmno11122002 should be replaced with
xyzmnoXXXXXXXX

Ok, so you've changed the spec ;-) Now you want.
1. Delete section_1, if it exists
2. Read in section_a from an outside file. Shoving it at the end is as good a 
place as any.
The two parts are unconnected.

To address a particular line:
# swap the first instance of x for y in line 1.
1s/x/y/
# Ditto, but for all lines in the range line 3 to the EOF
3,$s/x/y/
# Delete all lines between the first that matches the RE and the EOF
/SOME_RE/,$d

I think that modifying Steve's latest submission (the "I really enjoy this 
group" one) will do the trick in your particular case.

# To delete a section with one following it
/\[Section 1\]/,/\[/
/\[Section 1\]/d
/^\[/!d
}

# To delete a section at the end of the file no special casing is needed.
/\[Section 1\]/,$d

# To insert a new section at the end of the file. 
$r replacement.ini

That's it. Note that this is untested, but should work. You may need to have 
the '$r replacement.ini' before the '/\[Section 1\]/,$d' as 'd' returns to 
the top of the script (which won't be passed anything new if you've reached 
the EOF. However, as we've already noted, 'r' doesn't read syuff into the 
pattern space, so you should have no problems.

As Steve says, this is a fun list. Must try awk one day ;-)

One further thought:

Note that the order of these two groups IS important. Swap 'em around and 
'/\[Section 1\]/,$d' will delete everything after Section 1. As things are, 
any occurrence of Section 1 that is subsequently followed by another section 
will trigger the top group. Since 'd' returns control to the top of the 
script, you're safe.

A

To do that in vi:
:g/./s//@/
it will let you undo it as well.

In FreeBSD sed v 1.13.2.4, the $ (EOF) is eaten up by /\[Section
1\]/,/\[/{ if it is the last section.  So by putting $rreplacement.ini
as the first command it does work.  Thanks Angus, that's what I was
missing.

So, /\[Section 1\]/,/\[/{ means from 'Section 1' to '[' OR the end of
the file.  Is this the same behaviour in other versions of sed?

Thinking about it, it MUST be. sed is a STREAM editor; it has no idea of what 
is yet to come. Reading from my sed guide (all 11 pages of a chapter in "unix 
in a nutshell" ;-) merely confirms this:
	Two comma-separated addresses --- first matching lin and all succeeding 
lines up to and including a line matching the second address.

So, if the second address does not appear, we match to the end.

I learn and learn.

Subject: new FAQ question/answer
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I'm working on the sed FAQ and have decided to include this question
and answer, since it seems to come up often. Someone please tell me
if there is a more efficient sed script (briefer). The requirement
is that it must not alter the number of blank lines in the input file.

====

4.27. How do I change all paragraphs to long lines?

   A frequent request is how to convert DOS-style textfiles, in which
   each line ends with "paragraph marker", to Microsoft-style
   textfiles, in which the "paragraph" marker only appears at the end
   of real paragraphs. Sometimes this question is framed as, "How do I
   remove the hard returns at the end of each line in a paragraph?"

   The problem occurs because newer word processors don't work like
   most older text editors did. Older text editors used a newline
   (CR/LF in DOS; LF alone in Unix) to end each line on screen or on
   disk, and used two newlines to separate paragraphs. Certain word
   processors wanted to make paragraph reformatting and reflowing work
   easily, so they use one newline to end a paragraph and never allow
   newlines _within_ a paragraph. This means that textfiles created
   with standard editors (Emacs, vi, Vedit, Boxer, etc.) appear to
   have "hard returns" at inappropriate places. The following sed
   script finds blocks of consecutive nonblank lines (i.e., paragraphs
   of text), and converts each block into one long line with one "hard
   return" at the end.

     # sed script to change all paragraphs to long lines
     /./{H; $!d;}             # Put each paragraph into hold space
     x;                       # Swap hold space and pattern space
     s/^\(\n\)\(..*\)$/\2\1/; # Move leading \n to end of PatSpace
     s/\n\(.\)/ \1/g;         # Replace all other \n with 1 space
     # Uncomment the following line to remove excess blank lines:
     # /./!d;
     #---end of sed script---

   If the input files contain special formatting or indentation that
   may have special meaning, the user may want to consider the Unix
   'fmt' utility with the -t or -c switches, plus the width option
   (-w) set to a number like 9999.

Sorry that I have been to busy to attend to this question. I
believe this solution will serve your needs. I have tried to
annotate the script to explain how it works, but feel free
to ask about any details.

/^\[/, /^\[Sect_2]/ {    # From the top sect up to [Sect_2]..

  /^\[Sect_2]/! {H; d;}  # .. except [Sect_2], move to Hold
  x;                     # .. at [Sect_2], swap Hold+PSpace

  # At this stage, the Pattern Space might contain
  #
  #   [This_a] ... [That_b] ... [Other_c] ... [Sect_1] ...
  #
  # but it does NOT contain "[Sect_2]" since we omitted it.

  # See if [Sect_1] exists. If it does, replace that block
  # with something else. Use backslash at end of lines to
  # create multi-line blocks, and remember to include the
  # string '[Sect_2]' at the end of the replacement text.
  # We presume that if [Sect_1] exists, it ALWAYS precedes
  # [Sect_2]. If this is not the case, then the following
  # s/// command may delete too much.

   /\n\[Sect_1]/ s/\n\[Sect_1]..*/\
[Sect_1]\
  These lines here will replace      \
  whatever used to be in [Sect_1].   \
[Sect_2]/;

  # Or if [Sect_1] does not exist, add it to the end of the
  # Pattern Space. The newly-added text will come directly
  # before the [Sect_2] block, and the '[Sect_2]' line must
  # also be included at the end of the s/// command.

  /\n\[Sect_1]/! s/$/\
[Sect_1]\
  These lines here will be inserted  \
  directly above [Sect_2] section.   \
[Sect_2]/;

}  # This brace ends the /range/,/expression/.
#---end of script---

   I must give proper credit to where it is due. I could
not have written this script so quickly without the
marvelous sed script debugger by Aurelio Jargas, which you
can download here:

       http://sedsed.sourceforge.net

   Aurelio will be posting a one-line corrected version 0.7
very soon, which fixes a problem with Win2K input files
(which is what I work on). Thanks, Aurelio!

the global command is overkill here.
the :substitute command suffices. and,
yes, you can undo a substitution, too.

*any* filter can be used with vi through a subshell.

not much gain from ":%s/./@/", is there?

visual mode is an extension which
is not available with all vi clones.

but all this is stuff for comp.editors...
let's get back to the real sed stuff, ok?

Hi Al,

I've been trying to use SED to reformat reports but I fail to
solve one particular task: alignment of columns.
I've read everything about it on the net but nothing suitable.
Now I'm gg to ask help with other people, how can I subscribe
to your mailing list?

P.S. I'm currently trying to subscribe to sed-users ml on yahoo.

P.P.S. I've seen AWK and PERL, both too heavy - I need my scripts
to run on other people's machines and I can't tell them to install
8 MB Perl package.

Thanks

Mike

Hi guys,

figured it out myself. In short, 
1) make sure the column starts after the desired position (by adding leading spaces)
2) put an anchor at the desired position
3) remove the anchor and all leading spaces.

ciao

Mike

Subject: Help serach and replacing urls
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi,

I am a sed newbie who is looking for a quick way of searching and replacing
a single url in around 2000 separate html files.

Eg replace http://thisisthe/orginal/path.pl with
http://thisis/the/new/path.pl

I have been told this can be done quickly with shell scripting and and sed.

The machine in question is running sed and bash.

Can anybody help

Many Thanks

Using perl would have the advantage of enabling in-place editing of the files.  
Standard sed would require building a copy of the files and then replacing 
the original files with the copies.

xargs perl -i -pe 
's{http://thisisthe/orginal/path.pl}{http://thisisthe/new/path.pl}g' < 
PATH/TO/LIST-OF-FILES

You might also use super-sed or GNU sed 4.x, which are less ubiquitous than 
perl, but which both do have the in-place editing feature.  Check with sed 
--version if your sed is one of these, or download them from 
http://sed.sf.net/grabbag or ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/sed respectively.

xargs sed -i -e 
's{http://thisisthe/orginal/path.pl}{http://thisisthe/new/path.pl}g' < 
PATH/TO/LIST-OF-FILES

(both command lines have wrapped but should be typed on a single line)

Paolo

I have found this to work very simply by just doing:
sed -e
"s/http:\/\/thisisthe\/orginal\/path.pl/http:\/\/thisis\/the\/new\/path.pl/"
filename
for a single file on NT (I think you use single quotes in bash).

I would then put the following in a batch file:

for %%f in (*) do (
    sed -e
"s/http:\/\/thisisthe\/orginal\/path.pl/http:\/\/thisis\/the\/new\/path.pl/"
%%f
)

Or make it into a single line and type it in a command prompt.

I would go further back in time to ed which is an *interactive editor*.

1)  Create a file of commands called urlchange.ed containing:

1,$s,http://thisisthe/orginal/path.pl,http://thisis/the/new/path.pl,
w
q

2)  Create a file containing the names of the files you wish to change
(one file name per line) called file_list.txt.  If you know how to use
regex on the command line then skip this step and just put the regex in
place of the `cat file_list.txt` below.

3)  Then you can run the following (from a file or the command line):

for i in `cat file_list.txt`
do
ed $i < urlchange.ed
done

It will apply the commands contained in urlchange.ed to each of the
files contained in file_list.txt.  The names of the files can, of
course, be changed to whatever you like.

or to avoid UUOC:

while read i 
do
ed $i < urlchange.ed

OR

Subject: Column ranges?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   


Can GNU sed version 3.02.80 extract column ranges in an effective way?


EG: something like this pseudo code to extract column 10 to 20 from line
21?

type LIST.TXT |sed -e 21!d -e s/\(10,20\)/&/


Thanks.

If you want chars 10-20 of line 21:

sed -n '21s/.\{10\}\(.\{10\}\).*/\1/p' test.dat

If you want line 21 without chars 10-20:

sed -n '21s/\(.\{10\}\).\{10\}/\1/p' test.dat

As you can see, sed isn't very good at columns. You might try a combination 
of sed and cut

sed '21!d' test.dat | cut -c 10-20

and

sed '21!d' test.dat | cut -c '-10, 20-'

HTH
Angus

ps I'm not sure what the 'best' (most efficient) way of extracting line 21 
is. This is probably better than the above.

 sed -n '21{;p;q;}' test.dat

A.

Yes it is.  There is in theory an optimization in sed 4.x to disable
commands once their line ranges passed (and quitting if -n is there and all
commands disappeared) but it is not enabled because it can turn infinite
loops into "broken pipes":

yes | sed -n 1,20p

Subject: How to get actual line number?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi,

 I am using following script for my task,

#!/bin/awk -f
BEGIN {
   RS = ";"
   FS = ","
 }

/DbsVa[SG]etValues/{

    if ($NF !~ 0 && $NF !~ "NULL")
    {
       print FILENAME":" $0  ;
    }
 }

Here, I have given Record Seperator as  " ; ". Now, is there any way to
get actual line being processed ?.  

with thanks

Well strictly this doesn't compile in sed-users, but awk does
have two built-in variables that keep track of line numbers.

These are:

FNR - which gives the current line number in the current file

and

NR - which gives the current line number for all lines and
     files processed

For more information man awk.

So you can use:

    print FILENAME ":" FNR ":" $0

To print out file name and line number for the current file.

Subject: removing overstrikes
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

If I type (bash shell, where the backspace character is entered by
typing ctrl-v ctrl-h)

man modules.conf | sed 's/.^H//g' > out

the .^H combinations (which produce underlining and boldfacing in the
terminal output) are perfectly removed as desired, i.e. the file 'out'
is as it should be with no extra characters.

But if I create the script-file f1.sed:

#!/bin/sed -f
s/.\x08//g

and type 

man modules.conf | sed -f f1.sed > out1

the input is unchanged, i.e. 'out1' is same as the manual page for
modules.conf.

And if I change \x08 to \b, the result is again unsatisfactory.

Question: How do remove the extra characters with a script-file as I
have tried to do with f1.sed? And in general, how does one insert
unprintable characters into a sed script-file?

The version of sed is 3.02-14mdk which came with my Linux Mandrake
9.0.

"#!/bin/sed -f" - the "-f" is superfluous here.  and
using a hex value is not understood with every sed.

why would you remove the 'b' character? ;-)

pipe it through "col -b".  no extra file required.
sed is quite an overkill for this simple thing.

with an editor?

as usual, i suggest to use the latest version.

With vi/emacs you can insert whatever character.

Upgrade to sed 3.02.80, 4.x or ssed (resp. ftp://alpha.gnu.org

Subject: Whats wrong with this script ?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi Seder's,

   I have created a sed script to remove certain portion of the text 
from a file. 

Lines related to pattern (listed in file list.txt) are to be removed 
from file auto.txt

please run the shell script( syntax : remove_test list.txt rep1 , 
where rep1 is the sed script) and compare the difference betwwen 
original and output file.

My question is that, why not script is working for all the patterns 
listed in list.txt

(Files are listed below)

Any help will be very much appreciated.

Thanks

Sanjay

Just using 'grep -nf list.txt auto.txt', I can see that the
pattern should match on exactly 6 lines, which are:

  19, 81, 131, 184, 217, and 220

I don't use Unix shells, but from a little messing around and
looking at your script, is it correct to say that for each
filename in the last two lines of LIST.TXT, you are deleting
one three-line block (lines 19-21 and lines 220-222), but you
aren't deleting anything else?

And you do think the script OUGHT to be deleting more than
it does? I am fairly sure (having tested it and used the
Python sedsed debugger) that the cause is the multiple line
buffer you are creating by using the N command.

You are trying to match patterns by using "s/^pattern/repl/g"
when you should be using instead (also?) "s/\npattern/repl/g".
If you want to use both patterns, you could also use the new
GNU sed v4.+ or ssed, which has the /M switch, like so:

   s/^pattern/replacement/gM

The /M switch allows you to match the pattern if it is at
the beginning of the pattern space, or at the beginning of
any line within the pattern space.

I didn't spend a lot of time looking at the sed script, and
so I may have missed some of the nuances of the pattern blocks
you want to delete, but I think this clue should set you on
the right track. Hope this helps.

Thanks Eric,
          I tried using s/\npattern/replacement/g along with 
s/^pattern/replacement/g , and it worked.... exactly as I wanted.
Thanks a lot.
One more query here. 
why s/\(replace_me\)/&/g does not works in this case.

well, it *does* work!
you just might expect
something different..

so why do you say it
"does not work"?

now, if this list was moderated then i'd
throw out requests like these because
there is no description of the problem.

so - try again, please:
describe the problem.
describe what you expect.
describe results and error messages.
and mention the version numbers...

No it is not !
Try it on a sample input file and you'll see why.
(don't forget to add some chars after 'foo')

/^foo/{
  s/^/\

I've read the other solutions already. Try this one:

    sed "/^foo/{G;x;G;}" file

It's quite brief, I've tested it, and it works.

Thanks all for the mail. Can someone explain this please?
It works but when,
I tried putting all this on 1 line I got,

$ sed 's/^foo.*/\&\/' 1
sed: -e expression #1, char 14: Unterminated `s' command

Also, how do I put blank line before or after it. I mean in 2 steps.

With regards.

Hello Payal,

The trick is that it really is a three-liner  :-)
The backslash forces sed to take the following newline character literally.

By the way, I liked Eric's solution (/^foo/{G;x;G;}) because that is a real
one-liner.

It _nearly_ works. It doesn't do _quite_ what you expect on this:

$ cat trial.txt
bar 1
bar 2
foo bar
bar 3
foo 2 bar
bar 4
bar5
$

Unless, that is you expect to see this:
$  sed "/^foo/{G;x;G;}" trial.txt
bar 1
bar 2

foo bar

bar 3
foo bar

foo 2 bar
foo bar

bar 4
bar5
$

Angus

To which Angus replied:

> It _nearly_ works.

and then proceeded to demonstrate (to my horror), how well
it fails if there are multiple matches of /^foo/ in the
input file.

Okay, here's the fix:

     sed "/^foo/{G;x;G;x;s/.*//;x;}" file

which I've also tested on multiple matches. Thanks for
pointing this out to me. I wrote the first script while
eating my lunch at work, and although eggs weren't on the
menu, I suppose I wound up with egg on my face!

Anyway, the next message may interest you.

Subject: Time for a zap-hold-space command
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

A few weeks ago there was some discussion on the sed-users
list about the need for a command to empty the hold space.
I seem to recall somebody saying how rarely it comes up.

I, for one, would like to see a new command added to ssed.
It would zap (empty) the hold space, but not do anything
else. Appropriately, it could be named 'z' (for zap or zero)
and it would be functionally equivalent to "x;s/.*//;x;".

This request came up when I put together this script:

    sed "/^foo/{G;x;G;x;s/.*//;x;}" file

and thought it would be so much easier to write:

    sed "/^foo/{G;x;G;z;}" file

The only other command I can think of that would be
useful to add to the suite of sed commands would be
one to print the current line number without adding a
newline after it, which is how the "=" command behaves.

I'm not sure whether it would be more desirable to insert
the line number into the pattern space via a metacharacter
or escape sequence (such as \= in the right side of an
s/// command), or whether it would be easier to write the
code to print the line number to stdout separately, without
trying to modify the pattern space.

Just some thoughts from a lazy sed script writer.

I would very much like to see the version where it inserts the line number
in to the pattern space, since you can then process that number if you
wish. I don't see any reason why you couldn't have both commands, though.

I'm not sure, = is so useless as it is that I doubt that this command would
be much better :-)

This is a nice idea.

I like z

and \= seems more versatile than dedicated stdout

If we are doing this sort of thing, then could we 
also have \# which inserts a unique incrementing 
number each time it inserts, starting from 0 then 1,
2, ..., 9, 10, ..., 99, 100 etc

Actually, Eric, I think that you are demonstrating the desire for something 
rather more powerful --- and exciting. You are describing a macro, a single 
letter shortcut to existing behaviour.

Would such a beast be possible d'ya think? How would the syntax work? Perhaps:

Dz{x;s/.*//;x;}

as in Define z as ...

Reply-To: aurelio@verde666.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Status:   

hi all,

as the subject is "give your opinion", i'll do my part. :)
i'll extend the subject and talk about new GNU sed features
and KISS.

i'm sorry my words may seem stronger than the subject desires,
but it's really frustating that my english vocabulary is so
limited. i can't write exactly the way i think, but i hope
i'll not offend anybody, this is not what i want.


i really admire paolo's work and disposal to take the
GNU-package-that-NOBODY-wanted-to-touch, improving the
regex machine speed, correcting bugs and adding the
brother commands as 'Q', 'R' and 'W'

but i'm also worried that sed will follow the ssed way,
which in my opinion "has crossed the line" and its
more-than-sed. i appreciate the ideas and code effort,
but i don't use it because i like sed simple.
no perl mimic, no multiline mode, no system
command execution.




i dislike zap command idea

   there's no need to add a command that can be substituted
   by just 2 commands, and x;s/.*//;x is not that long!

   i think sed must remain as UNIX, little commands, that
   *joined* do big things.  x;s/.*//;x is just about it.
   "know your tools"

  
i dislike \# to do count idea
i dislike the macro idea

   these two introduce new concepts on sed, which in my point
   of view, are out of the sed scope and principles.

   sed is a text editor, not a programming language.
   anything more complicated can be easily made in
   perl/python/bash/whatever.

   there is no need to bloat sed.


i also dislike sed doing Perl weird Regexes (as ssed does)

   it was not proposed, but i want to make it clear that
   i think paolo's option to NOT include it on the GNU sed
   was right.

   ssed is a personal project and can go wherever it wants.
   but GNU sed is a worlwide program that ALL Linux
   distributions use for BOOT process (init.d scripts) and
   other critical stuff, so it must no follow the trendy way,
   but stay diet.

   if you want sed to mimic perl, install miniperl instead
   and be happy! sed is older than perl and has nothing to
   do with it.
   

i dislike the 'e' command and modifier inserted into GNU sed

   sed interacting with system commands is way far from
   what sed proposes to be. sed is about text, not commands.
   
   using this command brings to sed scripts a new world of
   problems it should never have! problems that the shell
   and shell script language should be used for.
    
   now sed scripts could not work if the system command used
   by the 'e' command:

     - has removed
     - has moved
     - was a symlink and the target has moved
     - is not of PATH anymore
     - is not executable (chmod -x) anymore
     - was updated and the syntax changed
     - ... (long list)

   and of course, platform compatibility is completelly
   lost on scripts that uses that.
   

i dislike the 'M', 'm' modifiers inserted into GNU sed

   sed is not multiline. sed was never multiline.
   sed knows about line.

   using 'G' is not multiline, it is still a single
   line on pattern space and it is treated as that.


i dislike the 'L' command inserted into GNU sed

   insert fmt into sed?
   not much to talk about this one. just plain wrong.


i dislike the 'T' command inserted into GNU sed

   maybe i didn't get the point, but it is really needed?
   the if/then/else structures was already fully supported
   by plain sed, as eric shows, so why T?
   http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/ifelse.txt
   


well, now i said what i should have said before but the
lack of time didn't allowed me to do it.

paolo, it is nothing personal. i admire you.
but as nobody droped a single line against *any* GNU sed
new feature, and they were HUGE, i wanted to speak.

maybe i'm just a KISS freak, maybe i'm a dinossaur inside
a young body, but i don't want sed to follow the way to
BLOATware as many GNU tools did. (hint: sort -u)


final thoughts:
  after all, dc.sed was written in vanilla sed.
  why us plain mortals will need more commands to "edit text"?

Hi,
Thanks all for the mails on this subject. Can someone give me 2
*different* scripts for inserting blank lines before and after a line
starting with foo.
In short I want one script which will insert blank line and one script
which will insert blank line after.

Thanks for the help and bye.
With regards,

Print blank line before the match:

	sed '/^foo/{x;p;x;}' file

	exchanges matched line with empty 'hold' space, prints the empty line,
	then exchanges empty and matched line so 'hold' goes back to empty and
	the default action will print the matched line.

Print blank line after the match:

	sed '/^foo/G'

	gets a blank line from 'hold' and puts it after matched line.

D is already 'delete till and including first newline' from the

I like the '\=' and '\#' ideas for the rhs.

How about ?

	sed '/^foo/{x;p;H;x;}' file

As well ?

/^foo/		find matching lines

x		exchange matching line with empty one
		from the hold buffer

p		print empty line before matched line

H		append empty line to matched line in 'hold' space

x		exchange matching line with the empty one
		appended into pattern space, leaving empty line
		in 'hold' for the next match

default action is to print current pattern space and
read the next line

I'd add 'T' to the list.  It is actually much more useful than W, which is
actually there more for symmetry and HHsed-compatibility than for anything
else. (more on this later).

So do I.  I am mildly in favor of \= only because = is completely broken.

You're right, but it makes sed usable for very simple things, like inserting
the current date in a log-processing command, which were not possible
otherwise.  I also use 'sed s/.../.../ | sh' pipes often enough that s///e
is a nice addition for me.

Right, and the manual warns about this.

Again, why?

This is the only thing where I have the doubt of having "crossed the line"
:-)  -i cost a lot of code (also to implement the associated option -s) and
\[lLuUE] did as well, but they are so darn useful.

The  ty bx :y sequence can be replaced by Ty.

You did the right thing, of course it is nothing personal.  You might like
to hear that I'm not going to implement $n in the s/// command. :-)

Again, I think the particular example you made is a matter of a feature
being very economic to implement.  But it strikes me that with all these
bloats cut -v is not there.

Hello,

some interesting points...

True in one way, except that z will presumable run rather faster.

> i dislike \# to do count idea

It seems like pointless bloat to me. Awk is much more suitable for that
kind of thing and has far greater (well easier to use) abilities in that
regard. I'm not sure about \=. = is a completely useless command. I've
sometimes wanted something similar, but = is so completely utterly
hopeless, that I've gone on without it.

> i dislike the macro idea

Agreed: One can always run sed through M4 if yow want macros. The tools
exist.

> i dislike the 'e' command and modifier inserted into GNU sed

I'll agree with that. Piping the result to sh or xargs is easy enough and
has far fewer problems assosciated with it: ie none for sed, since it
never knows.

I'm not sure about these: I checked the sed4.0.5 man page but couldn't
find it (I only had a quick check).

I'm not sure about this one. I find the structure suggested by ty bx :y
quite common. I have less issue with inserting small commands that add
very little extra, and which can improve readability of scripts. But it
isn't necessary.

	I can't comment much on Aurelio's rants, for two reasons:
	1 - I'm a sed neophyte. What do I know about it?
	2 - I haven't followed the latest changes introduced in GNU sed. Even if I
had, I wouldn't be able to tell new features from primeval ones.

	But I do know that PCRE are a super-sed thing and, albeit I love them
(super-sed and PCRE) and the extremely favorable view I have of them can
easily be taken with a lot of reserve, I still think it is worth
considering this particular point: the PCRE capabilities in ssed do not
interfere with anything else in (s)sed. Even if you do know plain POSIX RE
but have no idea of what PCRE are, you can write all RE that you want
without the risk of incurring some PCRE syntax mistake. You use PCRE if you
want, and ssed will only recognize it if you turn on the -R switch. Perhaps
that could be said of other new features recently introduced in GNU sed?
	OTOH, I do agree that someone (Paolo?) might be just trying to force sed
to do what is otherwise another tool's job. I also think that such
improvements should be made to super-sed, which is great and is a lot more
interested in the future than in the past, and is a lot less likely to
break Jur... I mean, legacy setups.

Good morning.

I have a requirement to modify the contents of a text file.

Then if [ABCD_Company] was found find the string Phone=

If Phone= is found remove "any" characters after Phone=
and replace it with Phone=2035551212


Any help is appreciated.

Thanks...

hi,
There could be many cases as I see...

1. ABCD_Company Not_Of_Any_Interest Phone=1423084320
2. Not_Of_Any_Interest ABCD_Company  Phone=1423084320
3. Phone=1423084320 Not_Of_Any_Interest ABCD_Company  
4. Phone=1423084320
   Not_Of_Any_Interest
   ABCD_Company
and other cominations of [4].

If it is one of the first two...

sed '/ABCD_Company/s/\(Phone=\).*/\12035551212/' file

[I am not sure for third as your post say's any
characters after 'Phone=', but then you will lose all other
data on the line]

So can U post the exact structure?
regards,
Praveen

The text file has any number of lines.

If  ABCD-Company  is found in the file then I want to look for  
Phone=  after where ABCD_Company was found in the file.  If  Phone=  
is found delete any digits after  Phone=  on that line and replace it 
with  Phone=2035551212

What if there is data after the Phone=xxxxxx? for example like,
Company=[ABCD] Phone=12345 email=xyz@hotmail.com

Subject: Re: Find string then second string and edit

If the two items are ALWAYS present in sequence on different lines, then
this logic will work:
1. Find ABCD_Company
2. If found:
   a. Look for phone and delete number
3. If not found, recycle.

In sed language:

s/ABCD_Company/&/
tFound
b
:Found
 s/phone=[0-9]*/phone=2035551212/
 t
 bFound

sed -f scriptabove file

I haven't tried this out, but, you get the idea.
There are lots of scenarios where this wouldn't work, but, this will give
you something to play with.

hi,
Does "x amount of blank lines" mean all the starting
blank lines, I am confused reading the second, that
states "stop at the first line of data".
If I understand correctly the following code should work.

sed -n '/^[^ ]/{
:lp
$!{
p;n;b lp
}
p
}' txt

regards,
Praveen

I need to remove x amount of blank lines with sed 3.02 in the
beginning of a file, but stop at the first line of data.

--
The sed one-liners by Eric Pement,
http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/sed1line.txt
 # delete all leading blank lines at top of file
 sed '/./,$!d'

 Translate: from 1st line that has at least one (any) character to the last
line of file: don't delete, (ie, delete all lines before hitting 1st line
that has at least one character.

The above solution is for just deleting blank lines that has no character
(not even space or tab).

If you want to delete blank lines (including lines contain only space or
tabs):
sed '/[^ 	]/,$!d'

Note: the spaces inside [] contain one space and one tab character.
Translate: from 1st line that has at least one character that's not a space
nor a tab, to the last line of file: don't delete.

How do I add this to a line with other scripts using -e.  I tried -e
and it wouldn't work, but piping the results from other scripts to the
above script did work.

Assuming that [ABCD_Company] will not be on the same line
as the "phone=" string this program will replace the first
occurance of 'Phone=' that occurs after the company string
match;

/\[ABCD_Company\]/,/Phone=/s/Phone=.*/Phone=2035551212/

Subject: putting it in script
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi,
I want to put my whole program in a sed script. But apparently it is not
working the way I want.

The commands which I am using successfully on command line are,

$ sed -n '/^foo/{n;p;}' sample.dat > sample-1.dat

This prints a line after the line starting with the regular expression foo.

$ sed 's/[ 	]*NANNY://g' sample-1.dat

This will remove [apace|tab] (any number of times) Nanny:

I tried putting it in a sed file like,

$ cat sample.sed
#!/bin/sed -f
/^foo/{n;p;}
s/[ 	]*NANNY://g

This doesn't work. I invoke it as,

$ sed -n -f sample.sed sample.dat

It shows the output produced by first command.
Can I give the -n switch in sample.sed?

Thanks and bye.
Warm regards,
-Payal

Try this:

sed -n '$q;/^foo/!d;n;s/[ 	]*NANNY://g;p' Infile > OutFile

Translate:
	-n		suppress default output unless p or P specified
	$q		quit at last line (there won't be next line to "n")
	/^foo/!d	delete all lines until matching line starting with foo
	n		read next line
	s/[ 	]*NANNY://g		remove all [apace|tab] (any number of times) NANNY:
	p		only now to print to output

Alternatively: you can do:
sed -n '$q;/^foo/{n;s/[ 	]*NANNY://g;p;}' Infile > OutFile


[Note] sed -n "/^foo/{n;p;};s/[ 	]*NANNY://g" InFile > OutFile
	Translate:
	-n		suppress default output unless p or P specified
	/^foo/{n;p}	when reach line starting with foo, read next line and output
			(notice you output before substitution!)
	s/[ 	]*NANNY://g		remove all [apace|tab] (any number of times) NANNY:
			(now you do substitute, but no output anyway!)

I think you have a misconception about sed scripts.

You can either put the command you have been typing 
into a shell script, in which case the script contains 
EXACTLY what you typed on the command line.

Or you can put the sed commands into a sed script and 
then call the sed script from sed on a command line
or from a shell script.

so you might have
$ sed -n -f payal.sed sample.dat >sample-1.dat

where payal.sed is:
/^foo/{n;p;}	#if a line starts with foo, replace it 
			#with the next line and print that next line
s/[ 	]*NANNY://g	#remove all whitespace NANNY
			#And then print the line (possibly again)

You can of course put the
	sed -n -f payal.sed sample.dat >sample-1.dat
into a shell script so you only have to type one word.

The script as written (un-executed so I may get this wrong)
will convert

abc def
ghi
foo
bar
foo   NANNY   bar   NANNY
frog   NANNY toad
xanadu
NANNY   biscuit NANNY   cookie  NANNY
xyz

into

abc def
ghi
bar
bar
frog   NANNY toad
frog toad
xanadu
NANNY   biscuit   cookie
xyz

I think you have a misconception about sed scripts.

You can either put the command you have been typing 
into a shell script, in which case the script contains 
EXACTLY what you typed on the command line.

Or you can put the sed commands into a sed script and 
then call the sed script from sed on a command line
or from a shell script.

so you might have
$ sed -n -f payal.sed sample.dat >sample-1.dat

where payal.sed is:
/^foo/{n;p;}	#if a line starts with foo, replace it 
			#with the next line and print that next line
s/[ 	]*NANNY://g	#remove all whitespace NANNY
			#And then print the line (possibly again)

You can of course put the
	sed -n -f payal.sed sample.dat >sample-1.dat
into a shell script so you only have to type one word.

The script as written (un-executed so I may get this wrong)
will convert

abc def
ghi
foo
bar
foo   NANNY   bar   NANNY
frog   NANNY toad
xanadu
NANNY   biscuit NANNY   cookie  NANNY
xyz

into

abc def
ghi
bar
bar
frog   NANNY toad
frog toad
xanadu
NANNY   biscuit   cookie
xyz

Subject: putting it in script


Hi,
I want to put my whole program in a sed script. But apparently it is not
working the way I want.

The commands which I am using successfully on command line are,

$ sed -n '/^foo/{n;p;}' sample.dat > sample-1.dat

This prints a line after the line starting with the regular expression foo.

$ sed 's/[ 	]*NANNY://g' sample-1.dat

This will remove [apace|tab] (any number of times) Nanny:

I tried putting it in a sed file like,

$ cat sample.sed
#!/bin/sed -f
/^foo/{n;p;}
s/[ 	]*NANNY://g

This doesn't work. I invoke it as,

$ sed -n -f sample.sed sample.dat

It shows the output produced by first command.
Can I give the -n switch in sample.sed?

Thanks and bye.
Warm regards,
-Payal

I have an input file (testfile.txt) who's lines are in the format:
<event component="foo" property1="1" topic="foo_topic" property="2" property3="3" messageType="fooType" >

I have created a sed script ..
$ cat simon.sed

1,/^END/{
        s/*.component=\("*."\).*property3=\(".*"\)/\1=\2/
        p
}

When I apply the script ..

$ sed -n -f simon.sed testfile.txt

I expect to get 

"foo"="3"

But instead I get the following:

<event component="foo" property1="1" topic="foo_topic" property="2" property3="3" messageType="fooType" >

Can somebody help me correct my sed script to produce the required output?

Many thanks in advance..

Simon

You have a couple of errors here.  The first one looks like a typo where you have *. instead of .*  The second error is that the asterisk modifier is greedy, in that it matches as much as possible: you should ensure that it doesn't match double quotes in this case: [^"]* instead of .*

Let the group know if this doesn't do the trick.  Best wishes,
Stew

Thanks all for the mail. But I haven't got a proper thing in which I can
insert a line before or after the regex.
Remember I want it in 2 different scripts. One for before and other for
after.

$ cat simon.sed
1,/^END/{
        s/.*component=\("[^"]*"\).*property3=\("[^"]*"\).*/\1=\2/
        p
}

You had a couple of .* inverted as *.
Also, sed will try to match as much as possible so be careful with ie:
/component=".*"/
as it will match from component=" all the way to the LAST quote.

Hello all,
I want to extract from the first column a string that represent a center.
This is either 1 or 2 digits. If I could take the last 4 digits then
whatever remains represents the centre. An example:

11001 will be 1 and 1001 whereas 470050 becomes 47 and 0050.


How would you do it?

Thanks,
Hassan

Hassan,

This seems to do the job:

$ cat inputfile
12345 Is this the real life, is
  234567 this just 333 fantasy. Caught in 55555
3456789 a landslide, no 666666
45678901, escape from reality. Open your eyes 888888
$
$
$ sed -ne 's,\(^[0-9]*\)\([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\)[^0-9].*,\1  \2,p'
inputfile
1  2345
345  6789
4567  8901
$

Basically, from the start of a line, look for zero or more digits
which are immediately followed by four digits which are followed by a
char which is *NOT* a digit (assuming you never have a non-digit in
the first column), which is then followed by the rest of the line (any
characters). The escaped parentheses, eg   \(  and \), pairs enclose
into two buffers the parts that you then want to print out (in this
case with a space between them) on the "replacement" side of the
statement. I've used a comma as a delimiter to avoid confusion with
forward-slashes.

s/search/replace/   =  s,search,replace,

the -n doesn't print out lines that don't match your criteria. The p
at the end says to print out the lines that did match.

This works on standard sed in GNU bash, version 2.04.0(1)-release.

 Hope that helps - if not give more examples of what you're starting
with and what you're aiming for,
  Pete

This seems so simple I must be missing the point.
But,
cat file | sed "s/[0-9]\{4\}$//"
seems to do what you asked.

Now, I assumed that this is the only item on the line. If there are a
series of columns, then this might work.

For example, if you had this:

11001 2022002 302302

cat file | sed "s/^\([0-9]\)\{1,2\}\)\([0-9]\{4\}\)/\1/"

This assumes that the column of interest is the first column, there are
no leading blanks or other white space, and the first column always has
5 or 6 digits.

Hello all,

This is either 1 or 2 digits. If I could take the last 4 digits then

How would you do it?

Subject: [ howto ] - get patterns for file #1 and apply replacement to file #2
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi,

trying to do some QMail parsing, I need to have sed watch for a set 
of pattern in a file and apply a modification to an other file when 
the patterns are match.
here's an explanation by example :

[ this is the head -3 of the snl.txt file ]
10172601:       mysmtp-09
10214439:       mysmtp-09
10486639:       mysmtp-09
[ this is the head -3 of the connect.txt file ]
10006698:       mysmtp-09       195.132.90.119
10163817:       mysmtp-09       64.15.239.131
10172601:       mysmtp-09       66.46.136.211
[ this is the head -3 of the desired result.txt file ]
10006698:       mysmtp-09       195.132.90.119      _
10163817:       mysmtp-09       64.15.239.131       _
10172601:       mysmtp-09       66.46.136.211       S

what I would like is sed to do some kinda :
for each line in snl.txt,
  if you find it in connect.txt then
    modify the line in connect.txt by adding an ending 'S'
  else
    modify the line in connect.txt by adding an ending '_'
  fi
rof

Using perl, I tried doing:
for i in `cat snl.txt`; do
  perl -i -p -e "s/$i/$&\tS" connect.txt
done
but it took ages (there are about 60000 lines in snl.txt and 200000 
in connect.txt)

I was wondering if it could be better managed with sed...

Thanks for answers,
        Jo

This is theoretically not feasible in sed, but... see below

You can't have sed handle twoinput streams at the same time.
If you insist using sed, you have to manage to find a way to
feed sed with the information from both files merged in one.
You can't obviously just cat the two files and let a sed script
handle the concatenation, because keeping 200000 lines in memory
is not feasible in sed.

If your connect.txt happens to be sorted, you could do 
something like (not tested, just typed away):

  cat snl.txt connect.txt | sort | sed -f foo.sed

with foo.sed doing (writing the actual script is left as an 
exercise for the reader):
  - keep two consecutive lines in the pattern space
  - if the number field in both lines are equal,
    add an 'S' to the big line, print it, and delete both lines
  - else if the first line is a small one delete it
  - else if the first line is a big one, print it and delete it

in perl, it *is* feasible to swallow the smallest file in memory:

  #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
  my %snl = ();
  open(SNL,"<snl.txt") or die "$!";
  while(<SNL>) {
    s/:.*//;
    $snl{$_} = 1;
  }
  close SNL
  open(CONNECT,"<conect.txt") or die "$!";
  while(<CONNECT>) {
    chomp;
    my $id = $_;
    $id =~ s/:.*//;
    if(exists $snl{$id}) { 
      print "$_\t'S'\n";
    } else {
      print "$_\t'_'\n";
    }
  }
  close CONNECT;

This sort of thing works, using comm and cut to make things a lot simpler.
This assumes that the first column is the important one and that the files
are sorted by the first column.
First, make file1 and file2 consist only of the numbers in column one.
Then, append a - to everyline in connect.txt and put this into a temporary
file.
Then, using comm, list only the common line numbers.
Then run throught the temorary connect.txt file once for each common line
number, removing replacing each - in the temporary connect.file with an S.
And so on.
Joel

cat snl.txt | cut -d: -f1 > file1
cat connect.txt | cut -d: -f1 > file2
sed "s/^.*$/& -/" connect.txt > connect.txt.temp
for i in `comm -1 -2  file1 file2`
do
sed "/^$i/{s/\-$/S/}" connect.txt.temp > junk
mv junk connect.txt.temp
done
mv connect.txt.temp connect.txt

   This type of question is actually designed for fgrep, not
sed, since fgrep is faster than sed and has a built-in option
to display (or suppress) lines from file1 which occur in file2.
Syntax:

   fgrep -f snl.txt connect.txt    # display if found in snl.txt
   fgrep -vf snl.txt connect.txt   # suppress lines from snl.txt

Your logic is inverted, since a line that cannot be found
cannot be modified. What you mean to say is this:

  for each line in connect.txt
    if a match exists in snl.txt, then
        modify the line in connect.txt by appending ' S'
    else
        modify the line in connect.txt by appending ' _'
    fi
  rof

> I was wondering if it could be better managed with sed...

I don't have a Unix box to try this on, but I'd guess the
fastest solution would be a combination of fgrep and sed,
especially if the order of the lines in the output file
doesn't matter:

   sort -u snl.txt >srt.txt  # simple optimization

   fgrep  -f srt.txt connect.txt | sed 's/$/ S/' >output.txt
   fgrep -vf srt.txt connect.txt | sed 's/$/ _/' >>output.txt

If the order of the lines DOES matter, then I'd use the -n
option for fgrep to obtain the line numbers and then use
sort one last time.

   fgrep  -nf srt.txt connect.txt | sed 's/$/ S/' >tmpfile
   fgrep -nvf srt.txt connect.txt | sed 's/$/ _/' >>tmpfile
   sort -t: -k1,1n newfile | sed 's/^[0-9]*://' >output.txt
   rm tmpfile

And this would keep the lines in 'output.txt' in the same
order as they appeared in the source 'connect.txt'. This
procedure seems to work on the small sample I tested.

Correcting a mistake in a script I just posted:

>   fgrep  -nf srt.txt connect.txt | sed 's/$/ S/' >tmpfile
>   fgrep -nvf srt.txt connect.txt | sed 's/$/ _/' >>tmpfile
>   sort -t: -k1,1n newfile | sed 's/^[0-9]*://' >output.txt
>   rm tmpfile

   That "newfile" on line #3 should have been "tmpfile".

Nope.  In some seds it is

sed -n '/\<word\>/p' <input file>

but it is not guaranteed to be there.  In Perl it is

perl -ne '/\bword\b/ && print' <input file>

   I tried using  sed -n '/\<word\>/p' <input file>, but could not

Is it specific to which sed I am using ?
How to know whether \< \> is supported by the sed I have got ?

Surely in GNU sed and ssed, dunno about others.

If my solution works it should be, else it is not.  Check out the sed FAQ
too.

  The escape characters \<...\> are supported by GNU sed, which
is the default version of sed distributed with every version of
the GNU-Linux package (Debian, Redhat, Mandrake ...). If you
don't have a Linux-based operating system, you probably don't
have a GNU version of sed.

> How to know whether \< \> is supported by the sed I have got ?

   You could try "man sed" if you are using a UN*X flavor, or
you could check your own system documentation. You could also
try checking from the command line:

   echo a b c | sed "s/\<b\>/WHOLE WORD/"

will print "a WHOLE WORD c" if \<...\> are supported as a way
to describe whole words, and "a b c" if this syntax is not
supported.

Subject: easy question...
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi-

I am not much of a sed user.  Actually very,very little.
I need to load a file into Oracle.  The file format has changed such
that 8 characters were added to the begining of each line.
The file is loaded based upon character position.  The file is not
delimited.
I am on a unix box. (maybe cut and paste, which I have never used
before..).

I need to take the first 8 characters on each line in my file and append
them to the end of the same line.


Thanks

Cindy

a) to remove them from the beginning of the line and append them 
to the end, do
  sed 's/\(........\)\(.*\)/\2\1/' < YOUR_FILE > THE_RESULT

b) to leave them at the beginning AND append a copy of them, do
sed 's/\(........\)\(.*\)/\1\2\1/' < YOUR_FILE > THE_RESULT

both solutions will leave intact lines containing strictly less 
than eight characters (not counting the newline).

Runing a) on the following two lines:
> I am not much of a sed user.
> I need to load a file into Oracle.
yields:
ot much of a sed user.> I am n
 to load a file into Oracle.> I need

Running b) yields
> I am not much of a sed user.> I am n
> I need to load a file into Oracle.> I need

Subject: multi-byte version of sed
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Sed users:

While working on the sed FAQ, which is in its final stages of
testing, I ran across this multi-byte version of sed, which
supports Japanese (multi-byte) characters, based on the
latest version of GNU sed.  I don't have the expertise to
analyze this and I've never unpacked the archive to look,
but if you are so inclined, here is the URL (if the URL
wraps, it shouldn't):

ftp://ftp1.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-stable/packages/Latest/ja-
sed.tgz

I'm trying to track down the latest email address of
Walter Briscoe (who prepared sed v1.6, which is a major

GNU sed 4.x does have multibyte support.

   I didn't have the tools to examine the ja-sed.tar.gz file
when I ran across it, otherwise I might have explained further.
Perhaps this is just a Japanese-specific implementation of
GNU sed, then? If you have time, maybe you can tell us how
multibyte support is used or activated.

   If you're busy, that's fine -- since I have no need to
know this information, nor am I working on any Unicode or
multibyte applications at the present time.  Thanks in advance.

It is enabled by default as long as your locale is set correctly.  I don't
think that it is possible on non-UNIX systems, however, as the Windows C
library does not provide enough functionality to use the locale data with
standard C functions.

Yes, I am, is it evident from the brief answers? :-)

Hi all,

How do do this using sed.

First, the (unspecified) whole-word problem. Though you didn't
say so, you probably want to match whole words, not match
partial words. If you have GNU sed, the default sed with every
version of Linux, then you can use \<...\> as boundary markers
to prevent matching embedded words.

If the words are always literal strings, just use literal
hyphens or whatever characters you like:

   s/\<Clinton\>/-------/g;
   s/\<Reagan\>/------/g;
   s/\<Bush\>/----/g;

If the words are regular expressions of variable length, like
"C\w+n", then you can do something like this. Note that it
assumes that you don't use literal braces "{...}" anywhere in
your input file.

   sed -r "s/\<C\w+n\>/{&}/g;:a;s/({-*)[^}-]/\1-/;ta;s/[{}]//g"

Hmmm... Let me break that down for legibility:

   s/\<C\w+n\>/{&}/g;   # wrap the matching word in braces
   :a;                  # set label :a
   s/({-*)[^}-]/\1-/;   # replace 1 nonhyphen with a hyphen
   ta;                  # if s/// occurred, return to :a
   s/[{}]//g;           # all done; delete the braces

Notice that I use the -r switch to save me a few backslashes.

If your input file MIGHT contain literal braces, then you can
replace "{" and "}" with \x1E and \x1F, two control characters
that are extremely unlikely to be in any text file. HTH.

Ouch!  Very cool though.

Am I right in thinking you don't need the hyphen in the character class in s/({-*)[^}-]/\1-/ (the second hyphen in this expression) because the asterisk quantifier is greedy?

Best wishes,
Stew

Though normally your intuitions are correct, in this case
omitting the hyphen in the character class will throw the
script into a permanent loop (in GNU sed, that is; HHsed
will terminate if it performs the same action 50 times).

The reason it will fall into a permanent loop is because
the asterisk quantifier is not only greedy but it also
backtracks, meaning that it releases the final character
successively trying to match the final pattern.

Suppose our input string is "A Tin Can", and the pattern
to match is still /\<C\w+n\>/.  Each successive iteration
of the script will convert this to (and I'm adding line
numbers for legibility) the following:

1: A Tin Can
2: A Tin {Can}
3: A Tin {-an}
4: A Tin {--n}
5: A Tin {---}

At this point, the pattern matching engine will start once
more, attempting to perform this substitution:

s/({-*)[^}]/\1-/;   # note that the hyphen was removed!

What happens next is that "{---" is initially matched by
the expression ({-*), but the next character is "}" and
our character set [^}] forbids the brace from matching. So
the * quantifier gives up one character, and matches "{--"
with the third hyphen being matched by [^}].

The pattern now matches and the substitution is performed.
What actually happens is that the last hyphen is always being
replaced by itself. The "ta" command kicks in, since the
substitution was successful, and we wind up with an infinite
loop. Yikes!

So, that hyphen really _is_ needed in the negated character
set, [^}-].  (Whew!!)

idea:
place the matches on a line by itself (by inserting newlines)
and then just replace the whole line with dashes.  after that,
just join the dashed line with the previous and next line.

Eric - how would this kind of solution look like in sed?

sed has no notion of what a 'line' is. I mean, newlines
in the pattern space will be considered as other chars, so it
is not very different to have "D'you like {Chocolate}?" or
"D'you like \nChocolate\n?". 
What can be done is to put the word "Chocolate" alone in the
pattern space, keeping the rest of the line in the hold buffer.
The script below demonstrates this.

------
# let's try to do it in plain old portable sed
# add a space before and after the line
s/^/ /
s/$/ /

# Quoting: ensure there are no = in the pattern space by coding 
# , as ,: and = as ,;
s/[,=]/&,:=;~/g
s/\([,=]\)[^~]*\1\(.\)[^~]*~/,\2/g

# loop while there is a word match
:loop
/\([^a-zA-Z0-9_]\)\(C[a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*n\)\([^a-zA-Z0-9_]\)/{
  # surround the first word match by =
  s//\1=\2=\3/
  # copy to the hold buffer
  h
  # isolate the word in the pattern space
  s/^[^=]*=//
  s/=.*//
  # change everything to hyphens
  s/./-/g
  # glue back the pieces
  G
  s/\([^\n]*\)\n\([^=]*\)=[^=]*=/\2\1/
  b loop
}

# Unquoting: revert our quoting chars
s/,;/=/g
s/,:/,/g

# remove space added before and after
s/.//
s/;$//
------

Notes: 
- the space before and after are needed if one wishes
  to match words at the beginning or end of lines 
- I've taken care to ensure that a given character (a = here)
  is free to use. if you *know* that it is not in the input
  then you can remove the quoting/unquoting parts.
- Quoting and unquoting can be done much more efficiently by
  simply swapping one char with \n (because \n is the only 
  char guaranteed not to be found in input lines). However
  a syntax like y/=\n/\n=/, although supported by POSIX, is
  not understood by GNU sed (I reported this as a bug).
- even though \n is guaranteed not to be found in input lines
  directly, it cannot be used like s/match/\n&\n/ because
  \n is not recognised in the replacement part of s/// command.

Hi all,
	I'm really very new to all this Regex lark, but I need to transform around about 1000 Microsoft NT4 DNS Zonefiles into MySQL INSERT statements.

So far, I've set about arranging my old Zonefiles into new files of the format:

domain	value

 - where 'domain' is unique.

I then crafted an ugly little bash script to echo back the appropriate values for each domain to create the SQL statement.  Unfortunately, my primitive method comes undone when I have files where each domain may occur more than once eg. For NS records

domain	nameserver
domain	nameserver
domain2	nameserver etc...

Please noone waste their time trying to do the work for me, but am I approaching this in the right manner?  Using sed and bash with simple regex?  



- I have included my bash script so far to give you an idea of what I'm doing:

###
#  Edit the variables to suit your needs.  They're just the
#  the files that hold the information gathered earlier.
#
SQLOUT="/root/dns/output/sql/$1.sql"
SOAFILE="/root/dns/output/soamail"
RETRYFILE="/root/dns/output/retry"
EXPIREFILE="/root/dns/output/expire"
REFRESHFILE="/root/dns/output/refresh"
MINTTLFILE="/root/dns/output/minttl"
NSMXFILE="/root/dns/output/nsmx"

# Make file ready for business.

echo    'USE dns_db;' > $SQLOUT
echo    'INSERT INTO `domains` (`domain`, `ns1`, `ns2`, `ns3`, `ns4`, `ns5`, `ns6`, `mx1`, `mx2`, `mx3`, `mx4`, `soamail`, `ns`, `changed`, `serial`, `refresh`, `retry`, `expire`, `minttl`) VALUES ' \
        >> $SQLOUT

# Gather all the important bits for the domain being processed.

SOA=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+//p" $SOAFILE`
RETRY=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+//p" $RETRYFILE`
EXPIRE=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+//p" $EXPIREFILE`
REFRESH=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+//p" $REFRESHFILE`
MINTTL=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+//p" $MINTTLFILE`
NS=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+\<NS\>[ ]\+//p" $NSMXFILE`

echo	"('$1, etc...')"

Many thanks,
	Aaron

But there's still the problem of knowing how long a variable-
length pattern will be, and thus how many dashes to use. In
a multi-line pattern (which is easy to get), you still cannot
simply write:

   /(^|\n)reg[e-x]+(\n|$)/ s/./-/g;

and get only that PATTERN converted to hyphens. I know--I've
tried it already, and even if I add the /m switch with ssed,
the entire pattern space will still be changed to hyphens.
The real trick is to use both the pattern space and the
hold space, as has already been demonstrated here by
someone else. But this leads to some very long sed scripts.

Somehow, the user has to get the length, either by a
recursive algorithm (such as I demonstrated) or else by
a built-in length operator, such as in Perl or awk. And
while I'm at it, this is the solution in Perl:

   perl -pe 's/\breg[e-x]+/"-" x length($&)/ge' file

Windows users need to switch the "double" and 'single'
quotes in the script above. Well, I'd better get back
to work now...

(I fear this is irrelevant to me - even if I know sed, I don't have
a clue what a DNS Zonefile is, or even what your INSERT statement
shoudl look like)

do you mean, that the value of the 'domain' field cannot be the
same in two different lines? - this is not the case in your sample
below. Also, are you *trying* to obtain your 
  domain  value
from another input not described here? or is your "domain value" 
the format of the input?

(adding line numbers)

is the nameserver in line 1 equal to the nameserver in line 2?
if then, a uniq or sort | uniq would remove these duplicates.

unfortunately I could not really understand your problem. It 
would help if you could state it in terms of source input and
intended output (with an exemple).

> - I have included my bash script 
>

if what you want with these sed invocations, is to just find
the *first* field 'value' whose 'domain' is the bash parameter $1,
then why not quitting when found?

  RETRY=`sed -n '/^$1[ ][ ]*/{s///;q}' $RETRYFILE`

A faster solution would be, if you can guarantee that for each 
'domain' value there is one (and only one) field in each of your
files, to preprocess each file with sed (replace "domain value" with 
"domain-1 value" in file 1, with "domain-2 value" in file 2, ...)
then cat all the resulting files, sort them, and
you then have to produce something like
  
  ...A domain ...B value1 ...C value2 ...D value3 ...E
  ...A anotherdomain ...B value1 ...C value2 ...D value3 ...E

from an input like:

  domain-1 value1
  domain-2 value2
  domain-3 value3
  anotherdomain-1 value1
  anotherdomain-2 value2
  anotherdomain-3 value3

This is rather easy in sed, like this:

  N;N;  # get lines three by three
  # and then replace "domain-1 value1\ndomain-2 value2\ndomain-3 value3"
  # by what you want.
  s/^/...A/
  s/-1 /...B/
  s/\n[^-]*-2/...C/
  s/\n[^-]*-3/...D/
  s/$/...E/

I hope it helps anyway.

If 'word' can mean anything including a regular expression
then you could first replace each match surrounding it
with newlines, then cycle through each part of the resultant
string and on every delimited part (the regex match is
border by NEWLINE characters) peform a substitution ;
s/./-/g

This assumes that your 'sed' can handle newline characters
embedded within a bracket expression (it should do)
otherwise the only alternative is to use a character that
will not appear in the input data (by embedding an asci 0x01
for instance). 


# replace every occurance of 'WORD' (which can be straight
# text or any regular expression) with the same number of
# hyphen characters. Set WORD in first line to desired query

Subject: RE: Easy problem
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Thanks for the suggestions, here is a bit more detail:

SQLOUT="/root/dns/output/sql/$1.sql" 
SOAFILE="/root/dns/output/soamail"
RETRYFILE="/root/dns/output/retry"
EXPIREFILE="/root/dns/output/expire"
REFRESHFILE="/root/dns/output/refresh"
MINTTLFILE="/root/dns/output/minttl"
NSMXFILE="/root/dns/output/nsmx"

I am using a real domain example here.  This is what the files look like (I've included the records for 2 example domains:

SOAFILE:
advsys.co.uk	dnsadmin.advsys.co.uk
domicilium.com	dnsadmin.advsys.co.uk
etc... with only 1 line for each domain.

RETRYFILE:
advsys.co.uk	600
domicilium.com	600
etc... with only 1 line for each domain.

EXPIREFILE:
advsys.co.uk	604800
domicilium.com	604800
etc... with only 1 line for each domain.

REFRESHFILE:
advsys.co.uk	1800
domicilium.com	1800
etc... with only 1 line for eacg domain.

MINTTLFILE:
advsys.co.uk	60
domicilium.com	3600
etc... with only 1 line for each domain.

NSMXFILE:
advsys.co.uk ;  Zone NS records
advsys.co.uk @                       NS pebbles
advsys.co.uk @                       NS barney
advsys.co.uk @                       MX 10      mail
advsys.co.uk                         MX 30      backupmail
domicilium.com ;  Zone NS records
domicilium.com @                       NS pebbles.advsys.co.uk.
domicilium.com @                       NS barney.advsys.co.uk.
domicilium.com @                       MX 10      mail
etc... with many records for each domain.  (Notice how the second MX record for advsys.co.uk has a larger number than the first).

My SQL statement for advsys.co.uk is going to have to look like the following:

USE dns_db;
INSERT INTO `domains` (`domain`, `ns1`, `ns2`, `ns3`, `ns4`, `ns5`, `ns6`, `mx1`, `mx2`, `mx3`, `mx4`, `soamail`, `ns`, `changed`, `serial`, `refresh`, `retry`, `expire`, `minttl`) VALUES
('advsys.co.uk','pebbles','barney','','','','','mail','backupmail','','','dnsadmin.advsys.co.uk','1','1','','1800','600','604800','60');


 So now I establish new variables which contain only the bits needed for my SQL statement:

SOA=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+//p" $SOAFILE`
RETRY=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+//p" $RETRYFILE`
EXPIRE=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+//p" $EXPIREFILE`
REFRESH=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+//p" $REFRESHFILE`
MINTTL=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+//p" $MINTTLFILE`

NS=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+@\?\<NS\>//p" $NSMXFILE`
MX=`sed -n -e "s/^$1[ ]\+@\?\<MX\>//p" $NSMXFILE`

And I use a few echo commands to build the SQL stuff:

echo "USE dns_db;" > $SQLOUT
echo "INSERT INTO `domains` (`domain`, `ns1`, `ns2`, `ns3`, `ns4`, `ns5`, `ns6`, `mx1`, `mx2`, `mx3`, `mx4`, `soamail`, `ns`, `changed`, `serial`, `refresh`, `retry`, `expire`, `minttl`) VALUES" >> $SQLOUT

echo "('$1','$NS1','$NS2','','','','','$MX1','$MX2','','','SOA','1','1','','$REFRESH','$RETRY','$EXPIRE','$MINTTL');" >> $SQLOUT

 You can see the problem now.  To use my method, I need to somehow create anything up to 6 variables for NS and up to 4 variables for MX.  For the NS records, each line in my NSMX file needs to occupy a cell in the database (in column ns1, ns2, etc...).  For the MX records, the line from NSMX textfile with the lowest number (always appear first in the textfile) should go in mx1, then the next MX line needs to go in mx2 etc...

I just can't see a way of doing this!  - But I realise that I might be using completely the wrong tools for the job, so any pointers are very much welcome.

Thanks again,
	Aaron

If I had to do it, I'd use perl, read all in memory in a big 
hash of hashes, then produce the output.
but now, your problem would be solved if you can replace
 do; Zone NS records
 do @  NS n1
 do @  NS n2
 do @  MX 10  m1
 do    MX 30  m2
by
 do 'n1','n2','','','','','m1','m2','',''
right?

Furthermore, it looks like only the first line for a domain 
contains a ';'. If this is true, then you can try this:

1) whenever the input line has a ; ship out the line in the hold
buffer (I explain below how), then put this in the hold buf:
  domain '@ns','','','','','','@mx','','','','
where domain is the domain from the line.
  /;/{
    # ship out (see below)
    s/ *;.*/'@ns','','','','','','@mx','','','','/
    h
    d
  }

2) when a line contains 'NS', replace in the hold buf
#  @ns','  by  %','@ns  and replace % by the value 
  / NS /{
    x;s/@ns','/%','@ns/;x
    G
    s/.*NS \([^\n]*\)\n\([^%]*\)%/\1\2/
    h
    d
  }

3)  when a line contains 'MX', do similarly

4) shipping out is then a matter of replacing
 do 'n1','n2','@ns','','','','m1','m2','@mx','','
by the correct output, so replace the #ship out comment by
this:
  :ship
  x
  s/@..//g
  s/,'$//
  p
  x
and don't forget to add a
  $b ship
at the end (else you'll lose the last entry).

(Of course the real script may have to be a bit more careful
especially if lines containing several NS, or MX , or @ or %
can appear - I let you sort the details out.)

Subject: sed to change colors
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Dear sed-users,
I am trying to figure out a way to change the color of standard out
using sed in bash shell.

Like # echo -e "Unit \E[32;7m $UNIT \E[0;40m"
Displays Unit with inversed colored number...

I'm trying to get sed to change color in substitution:
# truss -eaf -p 1821 2>&1 | sed s/operations/\E[32;7m operations
\E[0;40m (not working..)


SHELL: bash
OS: Solaris 2.6
SED: gnu sed 4.0

Has anyone done this or something similar?

Well, yes, but only because echo -e recognises a backslash followed
by a capital E and replaces it by an escape char

you should do:
   ... | sed 's/operations/^[[32;7m&^[[0;40m/'
with each ^[ being a litteral escape character obtained in bash by
typing control-V escape.

Type "sed --version" to find out what version of sed
is installed on the machine. If it's GNU sed version
3.02.80 or higher, then \x1B will also embed a literal
escape character (0x1B) in the output stream.

Subject: can any sed do directory recursion?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I ought to know the answer to this question, but I don't.

Can any version of sed do directory recursion? (I.e., traverse
subdirectories when doing in-place replacement).

On a related note, can someone please explain to me the pros
and cons of using xargs and (Unix) find to pass filenames to
sed? I'm revising the sed FAQ one final time before posting,
and want to know the benefits or drawbacks of using each of
these utilities, in the context of large numbers of files
and traversing directories:

   xargs ... | sed -f script.sed

   sed -f script.sed `find ...`

Thanks

Both have a lot of cons but the 2nd version has more cons than
the first :)

(You probably meant find ... | xargs sed -f s.sed instead of the
first command)

The xargs version is safer than the `` version. Just because the
shell (which expands the ``) may not be able to handle all
files if there are many. The xargs version knows how long a
command line can be and then eventually does more calls to sed.

Both versions have major drawbacks, they break at "unusual"
filenames. Thats spaces or newlines in filenames:

 $ cd /tmp
 $ touch "a b"
 $ find . -name "a*" | xargs sed -f /dev/null
 sed: can't read ./a: No such file or directory
 sed: can't read b: No such file or directory

GNUfind knows about an option `-print0' which will seperate
filenames with the \0 byte; and GNUxargs knows the corresponding
`-0' option.

The only real portable but slow solution is

  $ find ... -exec sed -f s.sed {} \;

For extensive discussion of find have a look at

Subject: inserting a character to front of line
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi All,

Is there a way to insert a character to the front of a line without a newline character causing it to start a new one?  Example :

cat snmpd.conf  | sed '/^system/i\
#'

This is inserting a # with newline character after it, which kills the desired effect of commenting out lines starting with 'system'.

Thanks,

Rich

Subject: all line started with "/" but not with "/."
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hello,

is it possible to put to commands in one line?

I have an file with entries like this

-- begin sed-input --------------
/.
/home/user
anythingelse
-- end sed-input ----------------

and I like to filter all lines that started with "/" but not lines
started with "/."

Following works

cat sed-input | sed '/\/\./d' | sed -n '/\//p'

Is there an command like "show lines started with '/' but exclude
lines started with '/.'" ?

thanks
Frank

hi,


You could use 2 'sed' commands, for example, the first command
could delete any line that doesn't begin with '/', the second
one could delete any line that does begin with '/.';

sed -e '/^\//!d' -e '/^\/\./d' sed-input

I don't think it is possible to put the entire thing as
one basic regular expression (although I don't have a mathematical
proof that you can't do it) however it can be done as one
extended regular expression which of course means you would
have to use 'egrep' not 'sed';

egrep '^/([^.]|$)' sed-input

This illustrates the difficulty also with using a basic regular
expression because while;

^/[^.]

will match most of the types of line you want printed, the bracket
expression [^.] matches one character but not zero, it won't match
the end-of-line so a single slash on a line won't be printed.

I think this does it. It also allows "." to appear on the line.
cat file | sed -n "/^\/\([^.].*\)*$/p"

Of course, I would always do such a job with sequential sed
statements. Why bother being clever when brute force is just as good?

This assumes the original poster wants to print out lines consisting only of
a "/" but not lines consisting of "/.".

Subject: using sed to get the directory out of a filepath
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I have a very simply Q.  I have a filepath:

/usr/local/apache/htdocs/bikes/road/wheels/index.html

How do I use sed to find the path:

/usr/local/apache/htdocs/bikes/road/wheels

This is all in a script:

#! /bin/sh

FILE="/usr/local/apache/htdocs/bikes/road/wheels/index.html"

DIR=$( echo $FILE | sed 's??????????')"

echo "$DIR"

What sould I be replacing the questionmarks with?

Interestingly I feel the same about the changes to GNU sed and some
recently proposed changes to GNU awk.  I'm a big fan of both tools, I
write more awk, but I'm more fond of sed.  Why do I write more awk?
Well, because some of the scripts that I write will be maintained by
others at work and I think that awk's syntax is easier to learn than
sed's.

I don't like perl much as my sig. shows.  Why?  Because of the things
that perl is and which worry Aurelio about the latest version of sed.
IMO perl is a bloated, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink, language and
it's too darn big!  And I don't want sed to follow the same route.

On one OS that I use the maximum memory is 4Mb or 2Mb depending on the
machine and I can run an ANSI-89 C compiler for that OS, plus awk and
GNU sed up to 3.02.80 from a 1.44Mb floppy disk.  Perl 4.036 can (just)
be compiled on the 2Mb machine, but won't fit on a floppy alongside the
compiler, awk and sed.  As to perl 5.0 it won't even compile on the 4Mb
machine and would take a lot of floppies to accommodate the modules,
etc..  I haven't yet tried to compile GNU sed 4.0 for this OS.

One thing recently asked for once again in GNU awk (it raises its ugly
head about once a year or so) is an include facility similar to the C
pre-processor directive.  This is currently made available through the
use of an external shell program called igawk on systems that support
it, but people seem to think that it would be better if it was a built-
in function.  No one has yet, IMO, provided a cogent reason for its
adoption.  There's no need for something that is currently available in
another tool.

I agree (sorry Eric) I much prefer the early UNIX philosophy of many
tools that each perform a set of well-defined functions linked by pipes,
etc.

I know of some interpreters for esoteric languages that have been
written in sed.  If you need to do counting in sed Greg Ubben has
demonstrated how this can be achieved in dc.sed and other of his sed
scripts.  Clearly if Aurelio can implement sokoban in sed then it is
already a pretty powerful programming language.

I agree.  It can already do most of these things if you want it to (one
way or another).  I think it was Paolo who demonstrated how to use sed
to write sed scripts (apologies here if it was someone else).

I agree.  Not because I dislike the PCRE regexes, but because I don't
want sed to become bloated.  I think the addition of EREs is fine,
though.

As Arnold Robbins (the gawk maintainer) has sometimes written, "If you
want perl then you know where to get it."  I sometimes abbreviate this
as IYWPTYKWTGI - along the lines of TMTOWTDI.

This may be handy, but is it sed?  Not really. it's a cut-down version
of some of perl's functionality.  IYWPTYKWTGI

Perl is multi-line - IYWPTYKWTGI!

And others have shown how to inclement while and for loops in sed if you
really need them.

I agree, too many changes make the tool too far removed from sed on
other platforms and make it more like perl - IYWPTYKWTGI!

Putting too much into any tool (or language) makes it unwieldy.  Look at
C versus C++, I know which I'd prefer to program in.  Certainly not C++,
which has been through many variations until the standard was published.
I think that the recent C standard may have gone too far with C.  I'm
quite happy with the C89/ISO C90 standard thanks.

And on a Sun box where there are limits to the number of sed commands
and it's still pretty efficient in operation.

Amen to that.

You can use the command dirname:

DIR=$(dirname $FILE)

or if you want to use sed:

DIR=($echo $FILE | sed 's/\(.*\)\/.*/\1/')

Since you mention it, I must tell you that I recently wrote an 
interpreter for the unlambda esoteric language, available at:

  ftp://quatramaran.ens.fr/pub/madore/unlambda/contrib/unlambda.sed

I've tried my best to use only plain sed constructs, but for yet
unknown reasons it fails on most sed I tried (runs only on GNU sed 
and HHsed).

Thanks. Where you find the information to separate more commands by
semicolon? I didn't found it by reading "man sed" or "man 7 regex".

It's in some man pages, not in others, but is covered in the
sed FAQ by Eric Pement.  The FAQ is well worth reading if you
use sed a lot; it contains a huge amount of information.

Yeah. This really got me when I started 'sed' because
it is a great UNIX tradition for the sed & awk manuals
not to be present in the man pages, you either buy a 
book or download the original manual, which coincedently
is available on my web-site here :

Embedding \n inside a bracket expression most
often is not supported, I would change this line;

s/^\([^\n]*\)\(\n\).*/\2\1/

To this instead;

s/^\([\
]*\)\(\n\).*/\2\1/

What's wrong with using 'dirname' ?

DIR=$(dirname "$FILE")

Thanks for pointing this, I'll try on older seds. 

However I beleive in written standards for portability, so I try
to stay within the POSIX rules. POSIX explicitely says:

  The escape sequence '\n' shall match a <newline> embedded in the 
  pattern space. A litteral <newline> shall not be used in the BRE 
  of a context address or in the substitute function.
  ...
  A line can be split by substituting a <newline> in it. The 
  application shall escape the <newline> in the replacement by 
  preceding it by a backslash.

I interpret this means I could replace:
  s/^\([^\n]*\)\(\n\).*/\2\1/
by
  s/^\([^\n]*\)\n.*/\
  \1/
or even
  /\n/{
    s/\n.*//
    s/^/\
  /
  }
but that 
  s/^\([^\
  ]*\)\(\n\).*/\2\1/
is explicitely prohibited by POSIX.

How about

s,\(.*\)/.*,\1,

for improved readability?

Subject: maybe too much to ask?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi-

I use sed very infrequently, but store away the emails from this list if
I think that I may ever need to accomplish a similar task.
My regular expression expertise is pretty much zip,zero, nada, a simple
match here or there.

Is is possible to sometimes include some English that may explain some
of what is going on?  Sometimes I have a hard time deciphering exactly what
is
being done, even with the question and the answer side by side.
It sure would help the newbies....
or maybe this list is for a more experienced sed user?
if so, can someone point me to a different list?

Thanks

Cindy

Thanks. I got the same information from Laurent. But I had only some
sedfaq.* there, without this information. I think they were crippled
somewhere or by someone. 

Now I have something to read.

well, It depends on the question asked. When a question clearly
shows that the poster understands BREs, then I suppose nobody will
be willing to explain in english what regular expressions do.

The newbies are allowed to ask for explanations if they don't 
understand.

I don't know of another one.

Here is an attempt at expliciting some recent REs found in this list.

> I interpret this means I could replace:
>   s/^\([^\n]*\)\(\n\).*/\2\1/
:     - match anchored from the beginning
:      ---------- this is \1
:        ------ zero or more characters other than <newline>
:                ------ this is \2
:                  -- a single <newline>
:                      -- zero or more characters
Given the pattern space "foo\nbar", let us call \1 everything before 
the first newline (i.e. "foo"), let us call \2 the newline immediately
following, and replace the whole pattern space by \2 followed by \1,
i.e. "\nfoo"

> by
>   s/^\([^\n]*\)\n.*/\
>   \1/
similar, but we do not name the newline \2, using a different 
syntax to embed a litteral newline in the replacement part of the 
substitution command. It reads
Given the pattern space "foo\nbar", let us call \1 everything before 
the first newline (i.e. "foo"), and replace the whole pattern space
by newline followed by \1, i.e. "\nfoo".

> or even
>   /\n/{
>     s/\n.*//
>     s/^/\
>   /
>  }
if a newline is present, replace the first newline and
everything after it by the empty string (i.e. delete the first
newline and everything after it) and insert a newline at the beginning
of the pattern space.
newline, including the newline

> s/\(.*\)\/.*/\1/
:   ------ this is \1
:     -- any characters
:         -- a litteral slash /
:           -- any characters
If the pattern space is "ab/cd/ef", it will name \1 "ab/cd" and 
replace the pattern space by \1, i.e. "ab/cd".
This is because sed pattern matching always uses the 
*LEFTMOST, LONGEST MATCH*. Here, \1 will be 
"ab/cd" and not e.g. "b" because it starts in the beginning on the 
line ("leftmost") and goes as far as possible right ("longest").

Here is a sketchy explanation of how sed implements this RE:
: ab/cd/ef
: >        first start from the first char ("leftmost")
: --------> match \(.*\)
: then we have to find a next character matching a slash. 
: we're at the end of the string, so the match for \(.*\) was
: too long. We go back one char and try again
: ab/cd/ef
: -------? still no / following
: ------?  still no / following
: -----?   aha found a slash. at this point \1 is (tentatively)
:          "ab/cd", the slash matches /, and we go on to match
:          .* which matches "ef".

> Or you could try
> s/\/[^/]*$//
:   11222234
this one is: starting from a slash (1), match a string (3) of 
any characters but slash (2) going to the end of the pattern 
space (4), and replace it with nothing (i.e. erase it).
Tried on "ab/cd/ef", it goes:
: ab/cd/ef
: >>?      find a slash.
:    -->   try matching [^/]*$ : this fails, there is a slash in the
way.
:    >>?   start again looking for a slash.
:       -- matches [^/]*$ : done.

As you can see, it is *quite* unfeasible to explain in details 
all regexps in this mailing list. I encourage you to try 
understanding this and ask questions when you don't.

regards,
Laurent

Hi,

We have the following situation:

We have a file that looks like 

#
#
#  Name: script_name
#
#  Description: This script will do .......
#               ................
#

We need to insert the values of Name & Description (in addition to 
some unchaged text) into an html file. The insertion should be done 
before the word </table> . 

The text we want to insert would be stored in another file which 
looks like :

<TR>
     <TH></TH> <TH>Name </TH> <TH>Description </TH> other text Name
</TR>

Can you tell me how would it be done using sed or any other tool.

Thanks,

first read your script and output the HTML code for it.
---script1.sed---8<---
# tag HTML metacharacters
s/[&<>]/&\&amp;<lt;>gt;~/g
s/\([&<>]\)[^~]*\1\([^;]*];\)[^~]*~/\&\2/g

/# *Name: /{
  s///
  s/.*/<TR><TH><\/TH><TH>&<\/TH>/
}

/# *Description: /{
  s///
  s/.*/<TH>&/
  # while the line is not '#' append
  :loop
  n
  /^#$/!{
    s/^#//
    b loop
  }
  s/.*/<\/TH></TR>
  # done.
  q
}
---script1.sed---8<---

put the result in temp file foo:

  sed -f script1.sed your-input-script >foo

let us call another-file the file containing

  <TR>
     <TH></TH> <TH>Name </TH> <TH>Description </TH> other 
     text Name
  </TR>

Then, read the HTML file and insert foo and another-file 
before the first occurrence of <table>

---script2.sed---8<---
x;s/^/first/;x
/<table>/{
  x
  # is it the first time <table> is seen?
  /first/{
    s///
    r foo
    r another-file
  }
  x
}
---script2.sed---8<---

Can you please tell me what these 2 lines are supposed to do?
For example, on this input:

   <aa>BB & CC</aa>

the script prints this output:

   <&amp;<lt;>gt;~aa>&amp;<lt;>gt;~BB &&amp;<lt;>gt;~ 
CC<&amp;<lt;>gt;~/aa>&amp;<lt;>gt;~

which is not valid HTML. The three symbols "&<>" must each be handled 
by separate scripts, like so:

   s/&/&amp;/g
   s/</\&lt;/g
   s/>/\&gt;/g

And this line:

>   s/.*/<\/TH></TR>

must be rewritten if it is to work:

   s|.*|</TH></TR>|

And then,

must have gotten jumbled when you tried to paste it.
(I suspect that you know how to use HTML tags, and that the
presence of "other text Name" outside of any TH or TD tag
pair is probably the result of a cut-and-paste error.)

Anyway, the idea is good, and I especially liked this
trick:

> ---script2.sed---8<---

>   /first/{
>     s///
>     r foo
>     r another-file
>   }
>   x
> }
> ---script2.sed---8<---

Although you could also use "1,/<table>/{ /<table/...}" to match the 
first time that "<table>" was seen. My technique would save a couple
of lines, but it requires that the first <table> be somewhere other 
than the first line. Knowing that the HTML, HEAD, and BODY tags must 
occur before any TABLE tags makes this a pretty safe bet for most 
cases.

Well, with the exceptions of the items noted above. Thanks for
answering so promptly!!

That's a good thing to ask. I don't always do that (like I didn't
do it with the last message I replied to), but it's something I
ought to keep in mind.

For a good intro to sed, you might look at this page:

    http://www.cs.hmc.edu/tech_docs/qref/sed.html

Plus, there is the sed FAQ, which is available here:

    http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/sedfaq.html

I have a substantially revised version of the sed FAQ on
the web right now, and when I get a reply from two people,
I'll post the URL and replace my "old" FAQ with the new one.

The new sed FAQ has much nicer appearance, the file now occurs
in sections, the Q&A parts are logically divided according
to categories, and massive numbers of URLs are fixed and
improved. If I don't hear from these two slowpokes, I'll post
the new FAQ regardless.

Hope this helps.

sorry I typed an erroneous ] by mistake. it should read

  # tag HTML metacharacters
  s/[&<>]/&\&amp;<lt;>gt;~/g
  s/\([&<>]\)[^~]*\1\([^;]*;\)[^~]*~/\&\2/g

yes you're right, it is much simpler. 
My technique is just a little bit more general and allows to 
transform, at the same time, e.g.
  a -> ab
  b -> ca
  c -> ac
which wouldn't be feasible one replacement at a time.

I agree it's wrong in HTML, but 't was in the original mail.

That's right. I just hacked it as fast as I could without trying to 
*think*, because I know I'm not very good with range addresses.

I would intrepret it differently because read a "literal <newline>" to
be different from an "embedded <newline>", as in below [*1]

The later is an escaped/quoted character rather than a literal
character, furthermore the standard even makes the distinction
itself, in [*2] (see below) which implies that an embedded <newline>
shall not be treated as a literal character.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Editing Commands in sed

In the following list of editing commands, the maximum number of
permissible addresses for each function is indicated by [ 0addr],
[ 1addr], or [ 2addr], representing zero, one, or two addresses.

The argument text shall consist of one or more lines.

[*1] Each embedded <newline> in the text shall be preceded by a
    backslash.

[*2] Other backslashes in text shall be removed, and the following
     character shall be treated literally.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whichever behaviour they intended to specify I believe that this
is at least in need of a clarification, I'm working on a defect
report at the moment for POSIX1003.2-2001 so when I've done that
I will make a request for clarification on this point. I've met
this before and the text really is not clear enough (as with a lot
of things). 

If they did intend your interpretation then already many versions
of 'sed' I have seen in the field will be *broken* because they accept
newlines in just this manner ("embedding"), anyway I'll try to get
the request posted on the POSIX mailing list in the next few days

Thanks for your work. I'm almost convinced (will just have to test
on a number of sed to just check what works where - and to check
the FAQ... ).

I wonder if the POSIX guys are aware that precedence between 
\n, \& and \x is (IMHO) not clearly stated. Is
  sn\nnfoon
equivalent to
  s/n/foo/
or to
  s/\n/foo/
and similarly is 
  s&foo&\&&
an equivalent of
  s/foo/&/
or of 
  s/foo/\&/
?

I have come rather late to this thread; indeed, I have purposely
avoided the discussion thread of sed extensions because in my past
capacity as a compiler writer, "language lawyer," and language
developer, I am -- what can be the word without offending anybody?
-- "concerned" by what I see (and have seen and seen and seen...)
as "suboptimal" language design. Lest this degenerate into a rant,
let me instead be constructive and give Brian's Three Rules of
Language Design:

(1) What _should_ work, _will_ work! (The language is consistent).
(2) Provide _tools_, not _features_, at well-defined levels
of abstraction. (The language is complete).
(3) Never, EVER, tell the programmer what he or she must or should do.
It is the ONLY duty of the language designer to satisfactorily fulfill
rules (1) and (2) and the rest will take care of itself.

If they sound rather putative and didactic, I admit this. It's just
that it's so frustrating when so few programmers understand the
mathematical concepts of language design and parsing theory that
it cannot be explained, ironically, that the essence of proper design is
just good common sense.

Concerning the above, do you realize what x;s/.*//;x has to _do_
merely to reset the "t" flag -- if I understand the context correctly?
Except for not having a "T" command which does this, the following is
MUCH more efficient, and doesn't eat into the command number limit of
some legacy versions of sed(1), nor zap the hold buffer. RTFM!

t label
: label

... Thus my "sd" debugger on Eric Pement's site. It was the program
I wrote before I commenced (and subsequently finished) writing a
k/sh lexical scanner and parser in (old) sed plus (old) awk (itself 2000
lines of code!), and implements conditional spypoint tracing on line
and/or pattern range(s), for the pattern and/or hold space, and for all
or a subset of embedded spypoints, just like any good debugger does.
sed(1) cannot step and break: hint, hint! A sed "hook" (perhaps to be
implemented with a new printf directive -- see following text) for use
with
an external debugger, is the _only_ debugging command necessary for sed.

Again, I admit that I have come late to this thread, but tolerate
me for just a bit longer, to say that I am of Peter's opinion concerning
complexity, and let me further add that ideas I have heard about the "s"
command are just plain wrong. Solve the _real_ problem and implement
extensions by allowing multiple and additional flags:

s///e # use ANSI escape sequences, including \n
s///v # allow var substs of (pushed) \1, \2, ...
s///g,w filename # [multiple flags!]
s///1-4,34-,w filename
s///g,v,t,e,1-4,w filename
# any others you can think of?

The above, as well as new printf/readf commands, a command to redirect
I/O
to given file unit numbers (file descripters), are the only commands
needed to be added. Rule (1).

Any extensions to the language syntax itself must be implemented
as allowing for a push-down stack: for pattern space AND hold space,
saved buffers (vars), printf/readf directives, and regexes -- which
would otherwise be implemented by functions, macros, multiple I/O
streams a la m4(1), etcetera. Rule (2).

Anything more and you might as well program in awk, as has been
previously observed. Rule (3).

Allow a command line option to source a given sed file, like bc(1)
does with its "-l" option. Make sure it is allowed to specify more
than one -l option argument.

All the above has the virtue of being both a proper superset of
sed(1) and P/NP complete. It is possible to prove this mathematically.

Forgive my impertinance, but it really _is_ quite a burden always being
right :)

Subject: newlines in portable sed
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi,

I'm trying to obtain a definitive answer to the question of how to:
a) match a <newline> in a RE
b) match a non-<newline> in a RE
c) insert a <newline> in the RHS part of a substitution
d) translitterate to or from <newline>

Experiments with sed implementations
------------------------------------
I carried out experiments on gsed 3.02, gsed 4.0.5, HHsed, sedmod,  
and the sed found on Atari Minix 1.5, all freshly compiled from the 
sources on cygwin (except gsed 3.02 which appeeared to be installed 
by default). I can publish a detailed experiment report if requested.
These experiments show that:

a) \n okay for all, \<newline> NOK on HHsed, sedmod and minix sed.
b) [^\<newline>] and [^\n] are both OK
c) \<newline> okay for all, \n NOK on gsed 3.02 and minix sed.
d) y/\n/a/ and y/a/\n/ OK except on gsed 3.02 and gsed 4.05.

Comparison with the FAQ 014
---------------------------
a) \n told explicitly to be valid by the FAQ, \<newline> not found
b) subject not found in the FAQ
c) \n suggested by the FAQ for a finite list of sed implementation,
  \<newline> also suggested; the FAQ does not state whether there can
  be cases where \<newline> does not work (the hint saying that the
  backslash may be superfluous on some implementations does not mean
  that the \<newline> construct does not work on these same 
  interpretations)
d) subject not found in the FAQ

Comparison with POSIX
---------------------
a) \n explicitly OK
  \<newline> "implicitly OK" according to Laura, but I'm not 
  convinced. I fail to see how the sentence
    "A litteral <newline> shall not be used in the BRE"
  can be interpreted to mean that a <newline> escaped by a backslash
  is allowed in the BRE. It seems to me that the sentence
    "the argument <i>text</i> shall consist of one or more lines.
    Each embedded <newline> in the text shall be preceded by 
    backslash"
  only pertains to the text argument of commands a\, c\ and i\.
b) After reading carefully the sentence
    "the escape sequence '\n' shall match a <newline> embedded in
    a pattern space" 
  I now realize that the term "match" could prevent interpreting the
  sentence as allowing \n in character classes.
  [^\<newline>] "implicitly OK" according to Laura, but I'm not 
  convinced for the same reasons.
c) \n NOK (explicitly unspecified), \<newline> explicitly OK
d) POSIX explicitly allows \n in both parts of y///

Comparison with existing scripts
--------------------------------
a) \n in dc.sed, 
b) [^\n] found in arkanoid, indexhtml, textoxml, toupper2
   and the GNU sed 4.0.5 documentation
   [^\<newline>] not found
   [ -~] found in the lookup-counter tutorial ("I use the 
   expression [ -~]* to mean "not-newlines", as you can't portably 
   put a newline inside a character class.")
c) \<newline> found in many scripts, \n not found
d) not found

Conclusion
----------

a) use \n
b) [^\n] and [^\<newline>] seem to work, but neither are 
  POSIX-compliant; [^\n] found in GNU sed scripts and documentation.
  [^\<newline>] not found anywhere except in Laura's scripts.
  [ -~] found in old scripts, but I don't like it because it is
  only a 7bit ASCII solution.
c) use \<newline>
d) waiting for GNU sed to fix its bug.

What would be ideal would be, that POSIX suddenly decides to
allow \n in character classes, and/or document that \<newline>
are allowed not only in the text argument of a\, c\ and i\.

I understand that, strictly speaking, such feature is not
absolutely needed as, in POSIX view, it is always possible to
replace
  s/[^\n]/foo  
by 
  y/\n@/@\n/
  s/[^@]/foo  
  y/\n@/@\n/
But I would say this is quite an awkward workaround (plus, it
currently doesn't work in GNU sed).

Until the time when either POSIX changes, or GNU sed fixes its
y/// bug, I really don't think there are efficient portable ways 
to handle the anything-but-<newline> expression in sed, which I 
personnally find very unfortunate :-(.

Subject: annotated 4.6 of FAQ 014
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

This is an annotated reading of the sed FAQ 014, referenced thus:

  Last-modified: 2000/04/28
  Version: 014
  URL: http://www.cornerstonemag.com/sed/sedfaq.html
  Maintainer: Eric Pement <epement@jpusa.chi.il.us>

I hope have taken the latest version. There has been rumors of
a yet-to-come version 015, but I could't find it.

Laurent Vogel

-------

4.6. How do I insert a newline into the RHS of a substitution?

   Six versions of sed permit '\n' to be typed directly into the RHS,
   which is then converted to a newline on output: gsed-3.02.80,
   gsed-3.02a, gsed103 (with the -x switch), HHsed (a/k/a sed14),
   sedmod, and UnixDOS sed. 

| HHsed is a/k/a sed v1.5, not sed14.
| \n in the RHS is also allowed in newer versions of gsed, such as 4.05

   The _easiest_ solution is to use one of these versions.

   For other versions of sed, try one of the following:

   (a) Insert an unused character and pipe the output through tr:

      echo twolines | sed 's/two/& new=/' | tr "=" "\n"   # produces
      two new
      lines

   (b) Use two backslashes (\\) from the shell prompt. Using bash:

      [bash-prompt]$ echo twolines | sed "s/two/& new\\
      >/"
      two new
      lines
      [bash-prompt]$

| Well, only one backslash would be needed if using '' quotes instead
| of "" quotes, AND it would avoid having to also quote $, ...
| Also note that this behaviour is not BASH-specific, it should 
| work on any bourne shell.
|
|   [sh-prompt]$ echo twolines | sed 's/two/& new\
|   > /'
|   two new
|   lines
|   [sh-prompt]$

   (c) Write a multi-line script and use the backslash (\) in the
   middle of the "replace" portion:

      sed -f newline.sed files

      # newline.sed
      s/twolines/two new\
      lines/g

   Some versions of sed may not need the trailing backslash. If so,
   remove it.

| if they do not *need* the trailing backslash, but still accept
| it, then there is no need to remove it. As is written here, it
| would seem that option (c) works an ALL sed implementation.
| If so, then it should be presented as *the* recommended way
| (instead of \n which only works on a finit number of 
| implementations). If, on the other end, option (c) does not
| work on some sed, then it should be explicitely stated.
 

   (d) Use the "G" command:

   G appends a newline, plus the contents of the hold space to the end
   of the pattern space. If the hold space is empty, a newline is
   appended anyway. The newline is stored in the pattern space as "\n"
   where it can be addressed by grouping "\(...\)" and moved in the
   RHS. Thus, to change the "twolines" example used earlier, the
   following script will work:

      sed '/twolines/{G;s/\(two\)\(lines\)\(\n\)/\1\3\2/;}'

   (e) Inserting full lines, not breaking lines up:

   If one is not *changing* lines but only inserting complete lines
   before or after a pattern, the procedure is much easier. Use the
   "i" (insert) or "a" (append) command, making the alterations by an
   external script. To insert "This line is new" BEFORE each line
   matching a regex:

      /RE/i This line is new               # HHsed, sedmod, gsed 3.02a
      /RE/{x;s/.*/This line is new/;G;}    # other seds

| in a script, the construct
|
|   /RE/i\
|   This line is new
|
| should work in any sed without consuming the hold buffer.

   To append "This line is new" AFTER each line matching a regex:

      /RE/a This line is new               # HHsed, sedmod, gsed 3.02a
      /RE/{G;s/$/This line is new/;}       # other seds

| same comment for
|
|    /RE/a\
|    This line is new
|
| Furthermore s/$/This line is new/ only works if the hold space
| was initially empty.

   To append 2 blank lines after each line matching a regex:

      /RE/{G;G;}                    # assumes the hold space is empty

   To replace each line matching a regex with 5 blank lines:

      /RE/{s/.*//;G;G;G;G;}         # assumes the hold space is empty

   (f) Use the "y///" command if possible:

   On some Unix versions of sed (not GNU sed!), though the s///
   command won't accept '\n' in the RHS, the y/// command does. If
   your Unix sed supports it, a newline after "aaa" can be inserted
   this way (which is not portable to GNU sed or other seds):

      s/aaa/&~/; y/~/\n/;    # assuming no other '~' is on the line!

| General comment 
| What is unfortunate is, that when reading this FAQ paragraph
| there seems to be no concern about how writing a script that
| should work on *all* seds. Obviously many *legacy* sed 
| implementations are buggy or not consistant one to another, 
| so I'm not that much interested in legacy sed implementations.
| 
| But is it utopic to dream of a day when it is possible to
| write sed scripts conforming to some standard (the POSIX 
| specifiation?) and let users upgrade their sed if it is known 
| to be non conforming?
| 
| For this reason, what I would really like in the FAQ is not a
| sentence saying "on this particular implementation, do this, 
| and on that particular implementation do that" (because it

Subject: sed: precedence between various \x syntaxes
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi,

We all know that expressions like
  s/a/b/
can be replaced by
  sxaxbx
for every char x (other than backslash and <newline> according to
POSIX). Furthermore, a litteral 'x' is noted '\x', so both:
  s/x\//foo/
  sx\x/xfoox
replace 'x/' by 'foo'.
Now I wonder what should be the right behaviour when x is
a) one of (, ), {, }, 1 to 9, &, n, i.e. characters for which 
  the expression '\x' has special meaning, either in the RE or the
  RHS, documented in POSIX.
b) one of other characters for which '\x' has a special meaning in
  extensions of some sed implementations, like +, ?, ...

as for a), I don't think POSIX documented the behaviour. A proper
norm should either state what the behaviour should be, or explicitly
state that the behaviour is undefined.

As for b), Trying on GNU sed, I observe that
  s+a\++foo+
is equivalent to
  s/a\{1,\}/foo/
even though it would seem legitimate to have it equivalent to
  s/a[+]/foo/
The reason why it should be so is, that a script written for POSIX
sed without \+ extension, has no reason to consider that '+' should
be a special character.

So, it looks like there is a bug both in the POSIX spec and in
GNU sed, don't you think?

This is a bug (as you already had told me privately).  It will be fixed in 
gsed 4.1 (not earlier because fixing it in a nice way requires a bit of 
overhauling of the treatment of backslash sequences).

I don't agree you need these.

sed is P/NP complete.  There is a Turing machine script on the grab bag.

GNU sed has many, many wonderful options! But I was talking about
(1) canonical enhancements that can be applied without compromising
backward compatibility to (2) a sed in the same lineage (and design
philosophy) as distribution sed(1).

Why not? Enumerated substitution sequence substitution is already
supported, and this is merely a range extension to that idea (1-4,34-
instead of just one number). I sincerely hope that you may find it at
least straighforward to implement.

"s///gw filename" works? Not on my (admittedly ancient) sed(1)! Nice
to know, though.

Certainly that's an idea.

I agree. But I was making a true effort (I made 15-20 drafts before
I -- incorrect ;) -- sent the post) as to Rule (2) -- logical
completeness of the specification.

> > printf/readf directives

It's true that readf is not in the vernacular of sed(1), but since I
have wished over and over for numerical evaluation and formatting,
strings in specific field widths, etcetera -- and especially because
field extraction and handling is such a pain in sed(1)! -- a printf
would really be nice. Sed(1) _is_ a filter, so I thought....

> I don't agree you need these.

I was hoping not to impress upon a list of enhancements, per se, but
to apply a little common sense to the "featuritis" that I see creeping
into the proposed extended sed. My only intention -- and I truly
made a effort to succeed at expressing this -- was to proffer a
comprehensive _minimum_ set of language elements providing _maximum_
usability. Of course, the final decision is yours -- but even this
does not necessarily mitigate against all that I have said if you
keep to a _same_ given level of design sophistication. Distribution
sed(1) shows by the existence of this very mailing list how much can
be done with so little, and is a credit to the "do one thing, and do
it well" overall design of Unix, which has worked so well.

> Why not -f?

Because the -l option applies to defining functions, setting macroes,
etcetera -- all those things I said were the "_tools_, not _features_,
at well-defined levels of abstraction." I hope you understand that it
_cannot_ be provided as an -f option.

> Can you expand on this?

I'm sure that I wasn't being very clear when I wrote this; to wit:
inasmuch as I was discussing pushing and popping regex environments,
the ability to push/pop regex's AND pattern/hold AND even numbered
buffers separately was key. The "v" flag would substitution \1, \2,
... from the current environment instead of the conventionally under-
stood behavior. The would be like variables, then....

I don't think you realize either the complexity of the P/NP problem
(it's a mathematical problem that has been worked on for a hundred
years), nor the applicability to a Turing machine to its proof (the
fact that turing.sed exists has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact
that sed(1) is P/NP complete or not.)

I don't think POSIX allows things such as \t or \xAA, yet I don't
see how this seriously hinders backward compatibility more than
\+ or \|.

Yes, but the parsing stage of sed (at least GNU sed) is already quite
convoluted.  Well I could steal some code from cut.

Well, that implies that you have functions, macros, and features of
*that* level.  It's quite a long way from the current sed -- the creeping
features in sed did anyway keep the same core concepts for all the
commands except perhaps the fmt-like L, and e (which I think is maybe
not orthodox for scripts, but is very nice for one-liners and pipelines).
The commands I added don't add constructs to sed, only functionality (Q to
quit without printing, T to jump on not substituted, R to read one line
of a given file into pattern space, W to write the first line to a file).

I probably misunderstood.  Isn't it that whatever is equivalent to
a Turing machine can compute any decidable problem?

This is desired in sed 3.x and 4.0, every call to match_slash explicitly says 
"keep the backslash in front of the slash".  It behaves differently in 4.1 
which I am working on (no new features, only better MBCS support).

By the way, I think that a / inside a multi-byte character should not be 
matched, should it?

ah? sorry, I don't understand what this means, but, anyway...

do you mean that, in 4.1, it would be equivalent to:
  s/a[+]/foo/
? I *think* this is the right behaviour according to POSIX ('litteral
character')

I suppose it should not.

That's why a terminating option, to assert extended ANSI usage, is
a good idea -- it provides necessarily (and often asked for) functionality
without compromising backward compatibility.

It was afraid it was so. I have not seen the source code of distribution sed(1)
nor GNU sed, but knowing Thompson's algorithm for the generation of
IFAs, I would not be surprised if it was goto-hell spaghetti code.

I had sent the email (after 15 drafts! :) before I realized the reason
that I had thought readf was so important was the very reason I was
going on and on about providing just such a hook for an external debugger.
My aforementioned debugger (before it get written _back_ into ksh(1))
cannot break at a spypoint -- that is, it cannot have specified the
place to stop execution temporarily to allow the debugger to browse
the current environment -- without some kind of read statement.
Very, very important.

I totally agree. Again, I was attempting to be "complete."

How is "Q" different from "d;q"?

Well, yes and no. The P/NP problem (AKA or analogous to the "P=NP?
problem," "p-time reducibility," "NP-completeness,") is indeed a
mathematical assertion asks if any set of finite objects of a certain
mathematical space (numbers, polynomials, ...) encoded in a finite
language that is accepted by a non-deterministic Turing machine in
polynomial time is also "decidable in polynomial time by a
deterministic machine." according an old textbook from college I had
to check; however, P/NP (not under that name) predates Turing,
although P/NP has come to be described using the vernacular of that
theory. Even in this, _I don't believe_ the Turing Machine has itself
"answered" the P/NP Problem. It is generally conjectured that the
answer is negative, but a proof of the conjecture seems to be far
away.

Additional examples of NP-complete problems are "SAT, 3-SAT, clique,
3-colorability,
graph embedding, travelling salesman problem, Nullstellensatz over
finite fields, bounded Hilbert's 10th problem, integer linear
programming, subsetsum problem, hitting set and covering set
problem," from the same text, of which I have personally studied
colorability, graph embedding, the travelling salesman problem -- and
Frege, having taking a format logic class at Cal Berkeley by a protege
of Kleene, a noted mathematician in that field.

match_slash (in sed/compile.c) has a parameter that tells it whether it
should remove the backslash in front of the terminating character.  In sed
3.x and 4.0 this feature is never used when parsing regular expressions.

Yes, it would.

Talking about a new command "Q" to quit without printing:

> How is "Q" different from "d;q"?

In the version of HP-UX sed I use "d" deletes the pattern space, and execution resumes at the first line of the sed script, so the "q" would never be executed.

Subject: Bug in GNU sed 4.0.5?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I am not quite sure it's a bug, but this worked in sed 3.02.80
(This script does not make real sense in its current form)

  $ echo foo | sed -n -e '1,/bar/{;//N;d;}' -e p -e q

gives:

  sed: -e expression #3, char 0: No previous regular expression

Note that its not -e expression #3 which is causing the error.
Is this illegal syntax? From a logical point of view I think //
refers to the last regex and /bar/ is the last one.

Well, lets' see what POSIX says:

  if an RE is empty, sed shall behave as if the last RE used in 
  the last command applied (either as an address or as part of a 
  substitute command) was specified.

note that it says 'the last RE used' in the last command applied.
When writing //N, the last command is 1,/bar/{ 
However one line 1 there is no need to try matching /bar/, because
the range 1,/bar/ will contain line 1 anyway. This is why '/bar/' is
not 'the last RE used' because it hasn't been used yet in line 1.
All this to say that I guess GNU sed has the right behaviour here.

Subject: GNU sed: bug in repeated sub expression?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi,

The POSIX RE page is quite clear about the fact that, in cases
like  '\(a*\)*' the sub-expression (i.e. 'a*') is not allowed to match the
null string UNLESS it is required to let the outer-expression to 
match at all, or to reach the minimum repetition count in cases like
'\(a*\)\{3,5\}'.

All this to say that, if I understand it correctly, the following
expression:
  echo abcd | sed 's/\(a*\)*/<\&=&,\\1=\1>/'
should give:
  <&=a;\1=a>bcd
instead of what is currently produced by GNU sed 4.0.5:
  <&=a;\1=>bcd
and similarly:
  echo aba,ab,a | sed 's/\(a*b*\)\{1,2\}/<\&=&,\\1=\1>/g'
should give:
  <&=aba;\1=a>,<&=ab;\1=ab>,<&=a;\1=a>
instead of what GNU sed currently yields.

Is it a GNU sed bug, or did I understand wrongly the POSIX spec?

Best regards,

Laurent Vogel

Subject: How to convert 1.2.3.4.5678 to 1.2.3.4
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hello

First off, please excuse this query that I probably would be able to work
the answer to myself. However, that would probably (AFAICT) involve a
considerably larger amount of resources (albeit on purely my behalf) than
seasoned sed'ers would require. Anyway, here goes:

Following a 'tcpdump -qln -r infile <filter_expression> | cut -d " " -f2' I
get a list of IP addresses and ports in the form of a.b.c.d.e, e.g.
1.2.3.4.5678 (IP address is 1.2.3.4, port is 5678). I'd like to remove the
port information, i.e. perform the following transformation:

    a.b.c.d.e => a.b.c.d

Any hints on how to do this with sed?

Many thanks in advance,
Tobias

I agree with both Peter and aurelio. Sed is sed. It has a long Unix
history and it is available in different versions on all Unix
platforms. To many new features and extensions to GNU sed will make it
not sed anymore.

I agree as well. Maybe in the smaller picture a zap command may look
convenient. But in the big picture, each new
replace-two-commands-by-one command addition has a much larger
negative impact.

I agree. EREs are an established Unix(Posix) standard by now, but Perl
REs aren't.

This is a good example, but from another angle too; I don't think
there is anything wrong with C++. However, C++ and C are completely
different languages, each with their own language specification. C++
is still mostly backwards compatible, being a super set of C. Much
like I imgaine super sed to be. It is a super set of sed, but it is
also it's own program. Anyone can install them side by side, or
replace their system sed with super sed. But for sed itself, just as
with C, I think there is a lot of legacy responsibility to not extend
it into something else.

No, no, no! This is simply not sed. Use awk instead. It is ridiculous
to make sed into a fully fledged programming language (it already is,
but I hope you get my meaning). There is already a multitude of other
tools to choose from if you need printf, file manipulation, variables,
debugger, etc. Why bloat sed? Why make GNU sed into something which is
not sed? 

I would recommend anyone thinking of all these dramatic extensions to
sed to read the original sed manual at Laura's site
(http://lf.8k.com/UNIX/SED.HTM). Then ask yourself if your extension
is really in the spirit of sed.

I understand the P = NP problem, but I fail to see what it has to do
with sed, and -- more specifically -- what it has to do with
extensions to sed?

I am sorry to add to my own post, but I thought of one more thing to say.

d95-bli@nada.kth.se writes:

All the extensions I have read about so far, was technically possible
to implement in the orginal sed (except maybe perl REs :-), yet they
wasn't. The design goals of sed obviously are different from those of
other Unix tools. I think any extension made to sed should be made
trying to keep the original desgin goals in mind.

I hope I don't come off to strong here, it is just that I feel
strongly about this issue, and about the Unix spirit. I don't mean
this as a rant. If GNU sed becomes to feature filled and bloated (and
I don't mean bloated as in binary size or memory foot print, but
rather in the featuritis sense), I personally will switch to BSD sed
or earlier GNU versions for use on my GNU/Linux systems. (I don't like
most of the new commands I've seen from the new GNU sed 4. I wasn't
aware of them until I saw them described by aurelio earlier in this
thread.) If GNU sed is becoming super sed, perhaps bug fixes could
still be back ported to eg GNU sed 3.x? Then there would still be a
GNU sed for people who don't want the bloat.

It depends on the context. I don't have access to tcpdump, so I can
only guess, but if the only thing on each line is the IP address, you
can do something like

        sed 's/\.[^.]*$//'

this is from the end of line. You could also 
- remove everything past the fourth '.', like:
    sed 's/\./>/4;s/>.*//'
- match starting from the end of line:
    sed 's/^\([^.]*\.[^.]*\.[^.]*\.[^.]*\)\..*/\1/
  or (if your sed allows repeated groups):
    sed 's/^\([^.]*\(\.[^.]*\)\{3\}\)\..*/\1/

If the addresses are in the middle of other text, like in:

  foo 1.2.3.4.5678 bar 8.7.6.5.4321 baz

then you can try:
  sed 's/\([0-9]\{1,\}\(\.([0-9]\{1,\}\)\{3\}\)\.[0-9]*/\1/g

Subject: Why isn't this regex matching properly?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Fellow sed-users:

   I thought I had a convenient answer to the question, "How do I
delete everything after a four-element IP address?", or in other
words, "How do I change '11.22.33.44.55' to '11.22.33.44'?" My idea
was to use the /n switch in sed to change the nth match of a pattern.

   So I tried a couple of things (Cygwin/bash shell, GNU sed v4.05):

--begin console output---

epement@sw218-et04 ~
$ echo 11.22.33.44 | sed 's/\.[^.]*//4'
11.22.33.44

epement@sw218-et04 ~
$ echo 11.22.33.44.55 | sed 's/\.[^.]*//4'
11.22.33.44

epement@sw218-et04 ~
$ echo 11.22.33.44.55.66 | sed 's/\.[^.]*//4'
11.22.33.44.66

epement@sw218-et04 ~
$ echo 11.22.33.44.55.66 | sed 's/\..*//4'
11.22.33.44.55.66

---end console output-----

   As you can see, the first two commands worked fine. If the pattern
had 4 or 5 elements, only the 5th element was deleted. This is what I
wanted.

   But boys with toys (and programs) have to try and break them. So as
the third command shows, if there are 6 elements, only the 5th is
deleted---which is not what we wanted.

   So I tried to make the pattern more general: /\..*/, which is a
literal period followed by zero or more other characters. However,
contrary to my expectations, this sed command did not find and delete
the ".55.66". In fact, it won't even find ".55" followed by EOL. My
question is this: why didn't the pattern match on the 4th period?

   I can answer the original request (sed 's/\./@/4; s/@.*//' file);
that's not my question. Is this an NFA/DFA issue? Is there a bug in
the /n matching routine in sed, or is something else causing the match
to fail? Thanks in advance for any help.

Kind regards,

Eric Pement - eric.pement@moody.edu

Since a RE is greedy, the pattern /\..*/ will match the string
".22.33.44.55.66", so there is no 4th match.

Q is not (except at a very high cost in performance, or by forcing one
to use -n).  R is not.

Don't worry, I am not going to add commands any more to GNU sed :-)

What will be added in GNU sed 4.1 (I already did so in my local copy, but of
course the release is far from mature) is:

- better treatment of multibyte characters.  A slash inside a multibyte
character will not terminate a regex.

- fixing the bug with \n not being parsed correctly in the `y' command

- enabling // in POSIXLY_CORRECT mode

- possibility to use Emacs-style backup file names when you use in-place
editing.  I need to do this with coherency with patch and other GNU
utilities, I agree it is not strictly necessary and bloats a bit.

> If GNU sed is becoming super sed

Since GNU sed 4, super sed does not have anything new except Perl REs.  That
is, super sed is simply GNU sed  with a different regular expression matcher
and with Perl REs.

And moreover, it would be wrong to disable the range on line 1.  Maybe
Tilmann wants 0,/bar/{;//N;d;}?

Yes, GNU sed 3 incorrectly referred to the last regular expression *in the
script* before the empty one.  GNU sed 4 fixes this.

How would I use sed to check if all characters in a 70 character 
field in a line is all spaces (20 hex)? And is sed a good choice? or 
awk? for this task? thanks.

sed '/^.\{CHARS-BEFORE-FIELD\} \{70\}/d'

That is, if you can match CHARS-BEFORE-FIELD arbitrary characters followed
by 70 spaces, delete the line.  Wrong lines are printed.

sed is good for this task.

hi,

What is a "field in a line" ? Is there one field per line ?
If there are more than one fields per line then in order to
formulate a solution one would need to know how they are deliminated.

Anyway, either way it is easy to do such a check with 'sed', you
do not need to type 70 spaces you can use the repetition count

RE\{n\}  will match exactly n occurances of RE

so the regular expression;

/^ \{70\}$/

would match a line of 70 spaces

To just match 70 spaces anywhere in the line simply get rid
of the anchors;

/ \{70\}/

Any more specific than that and one would need to know more
about the structure of the line/record (for example if there
are more than one field then which field you need to check
and how fields are seperated )

:-)

bestwishes
laura

I am not sure I understand you? I am saying that most of the features
suggested (or implemented) now were possible to implement in the
original sed way back when, and so I am suggesting that leaving them
out was a design choice made by the original authors of sed. That is
why I am talking about the design intentions of the original authors
of sed.

Didn't you alreay add several commands? I count to seven GNU specific
commands in the 4.05 manual. Since the orginal sed commands are 24, I
consider that a lot.

All these seem good to me. :-)

Are you saying that this is required by the GNU project? I'm not sure
I understand, how would you do in place editing with sed?

Ok. I never did look too closely on super sed, all I know about it is
from what I've read on this group.

I amused -- or frustrated -- that we are really talking about exactly
the same thing. I encourage you to read the entire thread to understand
the reason I made one of my infrequent rants/contributions was to defer
what I perceived was (1) another ill-conceived attempt at featuritis;
(2) inelegant and unacceptable proposals for the bugs and/or omissions
in sed(1) that I feel do need to be addressed.

We're on the same side!

What I was doing was examining a protocol for a controlled development
upon sed(1) -- not that I was necessarily encouraging enhancements.

And BTW, there is a VERY fundamental difference between language
completeness and "featuritis." As a talented language designer, I
cannot entertain discussion on this until at least the [mathematical]
paradigm is accepted.

It has everything to do with sed, extensions to sed, language design,
language theory, and indeed computers in general. I really cannot
decide whether to be frank or sarcastic, but I'll defer and hope the
issue will have been made clear with a reading of the previous threads.

Speaking of this, I read an intersting nota about it in the source for
OpenBSD sed (from the sed/POSIX file):

23.     Historic implementations handle empty RE's in a special way: the
        empty RE is interpreted as if it were the last RE encountered,
        whether in an address or elsewhere.  POSIX does not document this
        behavior.  For example the command:

                sed -e /abc/s//XXX/

        substitutes XXX for the pattern abc.  The semantics of "the last
        RE" can be defined in two different ways:

        1. The last RE encountered when compiling (lexical/static scope).
        2. The last RE encountered while running (dynamic scope).

        While many historical implementations fail on programs depending
        on scope differences, the SunOS version exhibited dynamic scope
        behaviour.  This implementation does dynamic scoping, as this seems
        the most useful and in order to remain consistent with historical
        practice.

So it seems like both behaviours are "correct" in a sense, but I agree
that using dynamic scoping is better.

Ah, I meant "it was possible to obtain their effect with the original sed".

> Didn't you alreay add several commands?

Yes, but I'm not going to add any more.

Now:
- W is present for compatibility with other seds that implement it; it can
be useful anyway
- T is a shortcut which can make sed scripts less spaghetti-like
- R is very useful
- Q can often avoid using -n and obscuring scripts
- L is definitely a mistake :-)
- e is useful though very controversial
- v does nothing, it can prevent subtle as in 4.1 and 4.0.6 it can accept a
version number

So I count 5 useful commands, 1 controversial command and 1 mistake :-)

It is just expected by some users who do use the VERSION_CONTROL variable
with patch(1).  You do in-place editing with the -i option in GNU sed 4.  It
works like

sed -i s/^/>/ FILE

adding > signs in front of every line of FILE.

I suppose I was expecting that to be the _first_ match, and the
engine to try matching again with ".33.44.55.66" (the second match)
and then try looking further. I've been reading Jeffrey Friedl's
book on "Mastering Regular Expressions" and I'm in the part on
how the matching engine does "bump ahead" to successively attempt
different matches one character forward if the first match will
not succeed.

Bjorn, I can see why your explanation is correct, but somehow
when I wrote that question, I was thinking that the numeric
switch would work differently. The way I would explain it to
myself (now!) is that I was hoping to get four different or
successive attempts to match the pattern on the input line,
whereas the /4 switch tries to match 4 simultaneous instances
of the pattern on the input line. Those two ideas are not the
same!

Thanks for clarifying this for me.

Subject: sed FAQ version 015 is now available!
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

The latest sed FAQ, version 015, is now available
at its new home:

   http://sed.sourceforge.net/sedfaq.html (HTML)
   http://sed.sourceforge.net/sedfaq.txt  (plain text)

The sed FAQ has been substantially revised, and the
HTML version is now broken into sections for quicker
download. The question-and-answer sections are now
renumbered and divided into logical categories such
as characters, strings, multi-line blocks, etc.

The previous version of the FAQ (ver. 014) is dated
April 28, 2000 -- nearly 3 years ago. This version is
dated March 10, 2003, and is as up-to-date as I can
make it. I am very receptive to changes, corrections,
or any way to improve the FAQ, so feel free to pass
them on.

I have also updated my home page, which has some DOS
and Windows-related information on sed and other
find/replace tools that use regular expressions.
That page is here:

   http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/index.htm

Thanks for all those who have waited so long for
the FAQ to come out. I will try to get the plaintext
version of the sed FAQ posted on Usenet tonight or
tomorrow. Please feel free to pass the word around.

Kind regards,

Eric Pement - pemente@northpark.edu

Subject: Selective changing of case
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hello all,

I couldn't find what I needed in the FAQs, one-liners or sed archives, so 
here I am with my hand out!

I'm working with a comma delimited file that uses all caps for every alpha 
field. Here is a 3 line sample (line 1 field names, 2&3 actual records):

NAME,ADDRESS,CITY,ST,ZIPCODE,ZIP+4,COUNTY,MSA,PHONE
FRIT INDUSTRIES,1792 JODIE PARKER RD,OZARK,AL,36360,0,DALE,"DOTHAN, 
AL",(334)774-2515
SENTINEL CONSUMER PRODUCTS,100 SENTINEL 
DR,ANNISTON,AL,36207,1012,CALHOUN,"ANNISTON, AL",(256)831-8377

Quotes are used to protect commas within a field - pretty standard stuff.

I am using this file in a mail-merge operation, and would like to change the 
all-caps to initial caps only, e.g. OZARK to Ozark

I also need to keep the NAME field (field #1) and the ST field (field #4) in 
all caps. There are also fields beyond PHONE that need to have case 
preserved. How can I do this (the quotes seem to make this really 
difficult)?

Thanks,

Greg Henderson

Thanks! Is there a diff somewhere, or would that be 
too incomprehensible?


...I do have a question. GNU sed version 3.02

I want to make some transformations of log files as I read them, eg

 tail log | sed -e 's/ MAC[^ ]*//'

but it seems to wait for the end of the pipe (cat log works), I couldn't
find any command line switches, so now I'm thinking to use 'tr' to trick
sed into action :) anyone know how or have examples? is there a better
way?

   Because I rearranged so many sections into so many
different places, besides adding and rewriting, a diff
file would not be practical. Sections were renumbered,
moved, added, merged.

   I will add diff changebars to the next version.

   Someone else may be able to explain more fully on this, but I
believe with GNU sed v3.02.80 (and above), the -u switch will
provide unbuffered output. I think this is what you need. I am
not sure whether this feature is in v3.02, however. You should
be able to type "sed --help" and get a list of all valid switches
(well, except for the -r switch).

  And since the new sed FAQ doesn't mention the -u switch anywhere,
I suppose I will have to put it on the "to-do" list for version 016!
HTH.

Oh, ok.

All the below is said IMO. I'd like to first say that I don't think
the fact that a feature is useful is a strong enough motivation for
including it. Any feature can be "useful" depending on how you look at
it. It is possible to come up with an example where even the horrible
L command could be "useful". IMO, one always has to look at the bigger
picture also.

Which other seds implement it? I don't see why it would ever be
particularly useful, especially considering it is very similar to the
existing w command.

> - T is a shortcut which can make sed scripts less spaghetti-like

It's functionality is easily replaced by three other lines. I disagree
that the impact of adding a completely new command outweighs saving 2
lines at rare places.

> - R is very useful

What is so useful with R that cannot be done with r?

What is wrong with using -n?

I agree. :-)

> - e is useful though very controversial

My opinion is that it is a huge mistake in the same vein as L is. It
adds a whole new semantic to sed, while not being of any use. If one
would like to process output from another command, the proper way is
to pipe it to sed, the Streaming EDitor.

So what is it used for? I'm afraid I don't see the point of a command
which does nothing. :-)

I count 4 questionable commands, 2 horrible semantic-destroying

Ok, I didn't see that this was also added. In-place editing is
contardictory to sed being a /streaming/ editor, IMO. The usual way of
doing in-place editing would be with ed. I also question the -s
option. It is very easy to implement the -s option, eg with Bourne
shell syntax:

        for f in file1 file2 file3
        do
            sed -f script.sed $f
        done

It seems to me that several of the exensions are for making it easier
to write self-contained sed scripts. Scripts that doesn't have to be
wrapped in shell scripts, or having to make use of any external
utility. IMO, this is very wrong. sed was designed from the start to
be used in conjunction with the other Unix tools, not replacing
them. All of e, L & -s are features of this type, and I suspect that
R, W & Q are in a sense too.

> sed -i s/^/>/ FILE

echo -e ',s/^/>/\nwq' | ed file

I know I'm coming of a bit harsh here, and in a way it is not very
useful to complain about the features you have already included. I'm
just out for the discussion really, of what sed is and of what it
should be. GNU sed is the default (and only) sed on many platforms
now, so it is a great responsibility.

I did read the whole thread, albeit cursory, if you are referring to
the thread "random thoughts about current sed and development" that
is. I think I understand now what you mean though, even if I disagree
that there are any larger omissions in sed that needs to be corrected.

I see that now.

I see now that you were arguing that IF changes were to be made, they
should be more in line with an overall design principle rather than
small patches here and there, ie features.

I agree. That is why I am talking about general design guidelines and
dito intentions. Changing those is an organised, structured way to make
changes rather than adding features here and there without considering
the language design as a whole. Am I interpreting you correctly?

Why don't you try being frank? I am a last year Masters student in
Computer Science, having studied both complexity and some language
theory. The statement of yours that I have trouble understanding is
the following:

    All the above has the virtue of being both a proper superset of
    sed(1) and P/NP complete. It is possible to prove this
    mathematically.

With "the above" referring to your suggestions of changes to sed. In
what way do you mean to say that those changes are "P/NP complete"? Or
are you referring to sed being "P/NP complete"?

You haven't gotten any responses yet to the list. I think because this is a
lot harder than it seems, and sed is not the best tool, at least not by
itself.

I would explore reformating your data base, replacing those delimiters
with something like a tab (changing all commas except those followed by a
space might work), and then using cut to put each field into its own file.
Every entry would have to have the exact same number of fields. Then,
you could manipulate each field easily, changing case to whatever. Then,
use paste or join or whatever to put them back into one big file again.

Naturally, make backups.

The question is a serious one. We maintian a fairly large natural
language (text+metadata) database (~ a half-million records) by using
software build tools and sed scripts. We do this instead of modifying
the database manually in order to avoid regression errors as the
database develops.

Between one release of the database and the next, we may have a dozen
or more sed scripts (along with other programs), each with anywhere
from a dozen to a couple of hundred lines. Heck, we had one situation
where we had a sed script generating sed scripts! Syntax highlighting
would be a help -- especially for regexes -- and a facility to
auto-insert backslashes when necessary...

I know that most uses of sed and sed scripts tend toward the one- or
two-liner as a filter in a pipe of some sort. I don't know elisp well
enough to write my own mode. I was just hoping there might be a way to
help the eyes cope with all those backslashes filling the screen! :-)

HHsed and sed 1.6

Well, if so, P would also be useless :-)

Everything :-)  R reads *a line* of a file *into pattern space*.  r prints
the whole contents of a file without allowing any kind of editing.  It is a
very common question "how do I mix files with sed" and my solution is
usually to take one file, pipe it through sed to generate a sed script, and
run the script on the other file.  R adds a much simpler alternative.

On second thought, it would have probably been better to add optional file
name arguments to the n and N commands.  But then w is also a mistake, it
would have been better to add file names to p and P which would have removed
the need for W... the original sed is damn good, but not perfect (and I have
not -yet- taken = into account...)

> > - Q can often avoid using -n and obscuring scripts
>
> What is wrong with using -n?

On a one-liner I prefer /bar/Q to -n /bar/q;p

There are additions, like \[lLuUE], which could be misinterpreted by other
seds.  By adding a v command you can ensure correct results.  Or there might
be known bugs that are fixed in later versions.

Well, that's a point of view :-)

Which is much more complex and not always really up to the job, for example
for complex tasks like removing C comments.  sed scripts are quite
widespread (at least on this list's subscriber's PCs...) and it takes little
to add -i to a command line.

The -s option is a freebie that is needed to implement -i correctly
because -i implies it.  It might be featuritis to allow it even when -i is
not there.

No, my intention was to make it easier to replace complex pipelines with a
single sed invocation.

Don't consider L.  It is a mistake indeed.  But e is designed to run other
Unix tools, and hence to make sed work in conjunction with them!

> R, W & Q are in a sense too.

Why Q?  And if R and W are designed to replace Unix tools I don't see why r
and w aren't.

Actually I didn't understand this at all too.  I cannot see why the proposed
additions (some of which might even be worse than L :-) make sed
*computationally* more powerful.  sed is already Turing-complete (I too am a
last year Masters student in Computer Science by the way).

Once you did so, you can actually use GNU sed 4 and do

s/[^\t]\+/\L\u&/
s/[^\t]\+/\U&/1
s/[^\t]\+/\U&/4

(The first command converts everything to initial caps, the second converts
the first and fourth field back).  With Brian Hiles' proposed addition that
would be

s/[^t]\+/\L\u&/2-3,5-

but no sed implements this and probably none will for a while.

I don't know if it is possible, but GNU sed has supported extended regular
expressions for at least 6 years through the -r (formerly undocumented)
switch.

Hmm. The basics are very similar, sed was desined as a stream version of
ed. It seems (to me) to be a case of adding features for people who don't
know how to use the whole range of tools. But that's just an opinion.

Not at all. If anything, I am afraid that I am too hard in my
critique. Being a maintainer isn't always the most grateful job to
have.

Is this GNU sed 1.6 you are referring to? (I have never heard of HHsed
before.)

I guess you could argue like that, but at least half of my argument is
that GNU sed shouldn't be turned into something which is no longer
sed. Maybe if someone were to design a streaming editor today from
scratch, it wouldn't look much like sed. Nevertheless, sed has an
important legacy to consider.

I agree it is not perfect -- but it is sed. Still, it is possible to
achieve similar effects by using more than one sed invocation. Sed is
not designed to be used for everything, and should not be used for
everything. Many times when you have several simultaneous input files,
awk is a better choice of tool for example.

Is that miniscule difference really worth introducing a new command
into sed?

I still don't understand. Are you saying that I could include the v
command in my GNU sed scripts to make sure that they break rather than
give unexpected results on another sed?

If I were to change C source files, I sure as hell wouldn't run an
automated script without keeping backups until I can verify that the
script result worked out ok. In short: it is almost always preferable
to keep the old file until the new transformed file can be verified.

I should mention that there are a few other ways of doing in-place
editing with sed:

1) The traditional method:

        sed -f script file > file.tmp
        mv file.tmp file

   Easy and reliable.

2) There are also ways to avoid having to create a temporary file. As
   I understand it, even gsed -i creates a temporary, so this method
   has an advantage to gsed too:

        (rm -f file; sed -f script > file) < file

   The method relies on the fact that a file is not unlinked as long
   as it is being accessed.

I see. I didn't make the connection between the two.

IMO, e is an absolute abomination. It doesn't fit in at all with the
rest of the sed commands or the sed philosophy, IMO. (The same goes
for L, but since you say it was a mistake, I won't harp on it. BTW, if
you consider L to be a mistake, couldn't you describe it as deprecated
in the manual, and say that it might be removed in a future version of
GNU sed? I cannot imagine it is of any wide use anyway.)

Are you suggesting that I cannot be in favour of not having R & W
without also wanting to get rid of r & w? I am not arguing for making
changes to the original sed, quite the opposite. I am arguing that
intrusive changes to the sed language should not be made to a sed
which is the default sed on many platforms. If someone wants all these
little features I am much more comfortable with them being made to
something which is not called or used as 'sed'. I thought that super
sed was something like this. Here is an idea I just thought of: maybe
GNU sed could be made so that when it is called as 'sed', all
extensions are disabled, but when it is called as 'gsed' they are
enabled? That would work a little bit like bash, which when called as
'sh', tries to emulate a POSIX shell more closely. It would make it
easier to write portable scripts.

HHsed and sed 1.6 are both improved versions of the original Eric Raymond

Usually what I do is tarring the whole directory structure, running sed on a
couple of files to check the results, then doing

    find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i -f script.sed

I might be too picky in counting keypresses, but I prefer

ls | sed 's/.*/mv & \L&/e'

to

ls | sed 's/.*/cp & \L&/' | sh

:-)

Note that all the changes in GNU sed, except escapes in regular expressions,
are 100% backwards compatible.  I am not sure this is true of bash.  I also
happen to agree with you about obtrusive changes, and that's why I am not
ever going to add Perl REs to sed!

I think \[lLuUE] escapes are *much* more intrusive, both in terms of source
code and in terms of  backward incompatibility (in that the script behaves
wrong silently instead of breaking), than for example Q or W, yet you don't
seem to have problems with them, only with new *commands*.  In other words,
I don't understand exactly what kind of extension you would favor.

I see. Are they actually in use, ie are they the default sed on any
platform? (Asking only out of curiousity.)

So you are keeping the tar archive as a backup? I don't see why that
would be more convenient than to just rename all files with a backup
extension, and then run sed producing the new files. To each his own I
guess. I often move the file(s) I want to edit to $filename.orig or
something like that before I sed it back into the original name.

I never use sed for such things. I would consider it a shell duty. The
common way to do it in the shell is by a loop,

        for f in *; do <sthg with $f>; done

I have written a shell function that permits me to write

        each "*" mv %1 %1.orig          # (bad example)

Well maybe there is no parallell. The reason I am opposed to e & L is
beacuse they are not 'sed', and the only things they make easier are
things that should be done with other tools, or in conjunction with
other tools. The reason I am a bit doubtful about Q, R & W is that I
don't think the gain from them outweighs the negative aspects of
introducing new commands, and breaking legacy with original sed.

I only mentioned bash because it is not sh, and does not try to be sh,
but sh-compatible. Let me show you what I mean:

1497 d95-bli@hasse:~> ll /bin/*awk*
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            4 sep 23 15:30 /bin/awk -> gawk
-rwxr-xr-x    2 root     root       248748 mar 18  2002 /bin/gawk

1498 d95-bli@hasse:~> ll /bin/*sh*
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root       541096 apr 12  2002 /bin/bash
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            4 sep 23 15:29 /bin/sh -> bash

1499 d95-bli@hasse:~> ll /bin/*sed*
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root        54949 apr  5  2002 /bin/sed

I am not comparing sed to bash or gawk, only saying that if GNU sed is
going to aim to be a superset of original/POSIX sed, then I wpuld
rather see the last example to look like

-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root        54949 apr  5  2002 /bin/gsed
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            4 sep 23 15:29 /bin/sed -> gsed

(This is all on a Redhat 7.3 system.)

You are right that bash is not completely compatible with either old
sh or POSIX.

That is because I was not aware of those extensions before you told me
just now. :-) Well, for the record I think those escape sequences are
just as bad as the e & L commands. Actually, even worse since they
break backwards compatibility as you say. I also don't think they are
in the spirit of regular expressions. They even more strongly
motivates having GNU sed behave like an ordinary sed when called as
'sed', but allowing all GNU extensions when called as eg 'gsed'.

I admit that case conversion can be a bit unconvenient in Unix though,
and it wouldn't hurt having some tool that would make it easier. It is
just that I think the sed extensions described above is a very ugly
way of accomplishing ushc a task.


Bjrn


=== Below follows a digression on how do case conversion in Unix. If
you are not intersted in that sort of thing, I would suggest not
reading it. :-) ===

 Here are a few ways of lowercasing filenames:

    809 bjorn@nex:~/tmp/tmp> ls
    ABC  Def  gHi

With awk

    811 bjorn@nex:~/tmp/tmp> ls | awk '{ print tolower($0)}'
    abc
    def
    ghi

With Korn shell. Unfortunately it seems like bash does not have any
functionality for doing this. Note that this makes it very easy to
lowercase file names, especially with the shell function I mentioned
above. (each "*" 'name=%1 && mv %1 $name')

    812 bjorn@nex:~/tmp/tmp> typeset -l name
    813 bjorn@nex:~/tmp/tmp> for f in *; do name=$f; print $name; done
    abc
    def
    ghi

With tr. this is possible with extended REs, but I don't think that
the order of the characters in the character classes is guaranteed, so
this is probably more luck than anything else. This is using
ISO-8859-1.

    815 bjorn@nex:~/tmp/tmp> ls | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
    abc
    def
    ghi

Everybody here is a Masters student of CS? :)

To say "computational more powerful" is problematic usage.
_Theoretically_, sed(1) have been used to send a man to the moon
in the 60s. I've seen DOS Batch libraries that do amazing things.

... But I wouldn't advise it.

If there is a keyword that for all my hot air would encapsulate my
intention and philosophy, it is "elegance of design," which usually,
BUT NOT NECESSARILY, is minimalistic. The Unix philosophy is always
a good paradigm: make a program do _one_ thing, and do it _well_.

I sought councel with a colleague who is more familiar with the distinction
between the P=NP Problem and Turing Completeness. As I had indicated, the
former predates the latter, and so the statement that _any_ language
(a "language" satisfying the three criteria of variables, flow-of-control,
and I/O) is Turing Complete. In this much, sed is Turing Complete,
_although_ a turing.sed (which I had known of before) does not indicate
TC in itself but that it is possible to have been written, which does
satisfy the conditions.

The P=NP (P/NP) Problem has always interested me; Turing Machines have
not. It is enough that the latter's existence provides an algorithmic
context to the former, but just like the fact that Cellular Automata
is now mainly only of academic interest, it is not practical in the
implementation.

I find myself in the awkward position of reinforcing my original thesis
that, although complexity and "featuritis" are NOT the same thing --
insofar as completeness and consistency of the language are concerned --
the fact that I have discussed push-down stacks of RE, pattern, hold,
and numbered buffers, enhanced I/O, etcetera, I did so because if sed
(or any other language) is to be extended and/or enhanced, there is
definitely a right way and a wrong way to do it.

Ultimately, although most of my ideas are for the "obvious" commands
omitted in sed that through my programmming of "non-trivial" projects,
I _really_ wish had been there from the inception, I am in favor of
minimalism.

I'm really quite proud of my aforementioned Three Rules of Language
Design. I've never seen an instance where this wasn't apropos.

What I'm really meaning to say, and hinting of in my case conversion
digression, is:

1) For short script and one-liners, if you want to do case conversion,
   sed is probably the wrong tool. There are already several other
   alternatives (like tr).

2) For longer scripts i think using the y command for case conversion
   is a fully acceptable method. Especially if the alternative means
   an intrusion on the design of sed while even breaking backwards
   compatibility.

You can name the program gsed and then use a script

#! /bin/sh
POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 sed gsed ${1+"$@"}

Escapes are all disabled in POSIXLY_CORRECT mode.

(Don't do that in 3.x and 4.0.x, it will break the empty RE)

I presume you mean

    POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 /bin/gsed "$@"

? If not, what is your script supposed to accomplish exactly?

That is good. Are the extra GNU commands disabled too?

Um, so which version can I actually do it in? :-) I have GNU sed 3.02
on my home box.

Of course.  Also, `v' disables POSIXLY_CORRECT behavior so you can use
extensions freely.

Not so far, but I can change my mind for 4.1 except for `v'; as they don't
break compatibility (besides, who would use \l in an expression) I don't
think it's necessary.

The yet-to-be-released 4.0a which is a pre-release for what will be 4.1 :-)

anyone has any sed scripts or good ideas in general for this
purpose.

There's the GNU Smalltalk test suite.  But you're going to benchmark the
regular expression matcher's speed, not sed.  sed does not have much to do
besides matching REs.

Among those I know, the ranking is ssed-gsed3-gsed4-gsed2.

Well, with more advanced scripts, other functionality could also be
tested I think. Things like branching, working with the hold space,
etc. Maybe you are right, and the RE engine is the deciding factor.

Umm... which direction is the scale? Slowest to fastest?

The script below should do pretty much everything you want except keep
fields beyond PHONE intact (to do that too, you'd have to adapt the
'interweaving' part). I tried to explain in some details, but feel free
to ask specific questions about it.

Did anybody but Eric ever see Sed1.6 running? I just can't seem to reach

I only started writing sed scripts recently, so I don't have any good
sed scripts except my unlambda interpreter.
gsed 4.0.5 has a (kind of) testsuite made of several existing sed scripts.
I've recently started expanding hhsed too, so I'd be very interested in
a test suite (I'm in the process of reviewing that of gnu sed to extract
the non-POSIX stuff out of it and try to see what is missing).

When testing my unlambda interpreted I remember that plain old hhsed used
to be up to seven times faster than GSED 4.0.5 on some input. (This is
why I started updating hhsed to make it more POSIXLY correct).

well, both behaviours may have appeared to be correct *in the past*, but
*now* POSIX documents dynamic scoping as being the proper behaviour.

Ah ok. In the text I quoted, it says that POSIX doesn't document which
behaviour is right, but I guess that it has been specified since.

The recent discussion on the exensions in GNU sed prompted me to port
BSD sed to my Linux box. Then I thought it would be interesting to see
if there are any performance differences.

I ran your Unlambda interpreter on the Hello.unl program from the
Unlambda Archive. The results were that BSD sed (taken from OpenBSD)
were almost three times as fast as GNU sed 3.02. I haven't tested any
other seds yet.

I don't know the unlambda interpreter code well enough to know what
this test is stressing (eg REs, hold buffer manipulation, etc), but
the difference is nevertheless big.

Do you know where I could find HHsed?

I have the source code somewhere, it could be uploaded to sed.sf.net.  It has 
an interesting debugging facility.

How come super sed is so much faster than GNU sed? I just benchmarked,
and it is quite a large difference.

Me and the author of PCRE (on which ssed is based) seem to be better at 
writing regex engines than the GNU people :-)  PCRE is very fast because it 
does fewer pass around the innermost matching loop, and I added several 
features especially for ssed, such as:

- Boyer-Moore search of initial prefixes: on matching fixed strings, you can 
speed the search by a factor equal to the length of the string.

- pruning of the beginning of the search string for some $-anchored patterns: 
when matching [.?!]$ for example the matcher actually looks at the last 
character of pattern space only, and ssed AFAIK is the only open-source sed 
to do so!

- pruning of some unfruitful backtracking paths such as [^b]*b which are quite 
common.

Actually, this is only part of the story because gsed2 and gsed4 are widely 
more POSIX compliant than gsed3 and ssed.  I don't know whether this is 
actually something to care about, but the current GNU regular expression 
matcher actually picks the leftmost-longest match:

(abc|abcd)(def|efgh)

For gsed3 and ssed (and most other seds I know of), you'll have abcdef, while 
gsed2 and gsed4 will yield abcdefgh.

(More on this can be found in Mastering Regular Expressions -- see the 
difference between NFA and POSIX NFA).

Ah, ok. I had just assumed that super sed was based on the GNU sed
codebase, but with some extensions. Now you are telling me that super
sed is written from scratch, and that its RE matcher is PCRE, is that
correct?

BSD sed uses the RE library in the C library. I assumed that gsed did
this too, but now it seems like GNU sed comes with its own RE code. I
wonder why, especially consdiering it is so much slower than BSD sed
which is using the library.

So basically you are doing some optimisations before starting the RE
search by observing properties of the RE pattern?

This one I don't understand. Care to elaborate?

I think POSIX compliency is important.

Thanks, I will look it up.

No, super sed is based on the GNU sed 3 codebase, with some extensions that 
later got merged in GNU sed 4, and with a matcher of its own which is based 
on PCRE but can also parse POSIX regexes in additional to Perl ones.

> BSD sed uses the RE library in the C library. I assumed that gsed did

GNU sed 4 uses the same matcher as glibc 2.3 and GNU sed 3 uses the same 
matcher as previous versions of glibc.

> So basically you are doing some optimisations before starting the RE
> search by observing properties of the RE pattern?

Yes.  This is not so uncommon -- for example most matchers try to build a set 
of the characters which can possibly begin a match.

>
> This one I don't understand. Care to elaborate?

If you have a regular expression such as [^b]*b with a pattern like 
aaaacccceeee, ssed will first match [^b]* greedily.  Then when it fails to 
match the 'b', it knows that no matter how it shortens the portion that 
matched [^b]*, the 'b' will not match.  So it aborts the search without doing 
any backtracking.

So basically the super sed matcher is much faster than the gsed
one. Any thoughts of merging the ssed matcher into gsed?

Then my benchmark results are even more strange then. Both the BSD sed
and gsed I used were compiled and run on the same platform, against
glibc 2.2.1. Yet still BSD sed was almost four times faster, and this
difference must then lie outside of the RE engine. What is gsed doing
wrong?

It sounds like a sensible thing to do. But shouldn't much of these
kind of optimizations ideally lie in the regex library? (Maybe they do
in the case of PCRE, but they should in the glibc RE matcher too, I
think. If applications are to use the RE matcher provided in glibc, it
should be heavily optimzised for performance, IMO.)

Now I've never written an RE matcher, but this seems to me to be the
most natural way of doing it. How would an RE matcher without this
optimization perform this match?

In a message formerly entitled "Tests and benchmarks", Bjorn asked:
 
>  Do you know where I could find HHsed?
 
Sure. HHsed, a/k/a sed15, stands for Howard Helman's sed. Until recently, it was the
most widely distributed version of sed available for MS-DOS users, being fixed and
distributed in 1991. The file you want is sed15.zip, which contains zip files inside of
zip files. The HISTORY.ZIP member file within it contains archived email discussions
between Helman and the other programmers, describing their reasons for making
certain decisions about how/why to implement certain features. sed15 is here:
 
      http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/index.htm
 
As you may know, Walter Briscoe rewrote and debugged HHsed (sed15), which
he has released to a few people for beta testing as sed16, which is available in both
16-bit and 32-bit versions. It fixes nearly all the bugs in sed15, as you can see from
section 7 in the latest version of the sed FAQ
 
The beta is packed with a GNU GPL,so I don't have any qualms about distributing
it for further refinement or testing ... except that the computer containing this file
is inaccessible right now. I've tried e-mailing Walter Briscoe several times, and
have not been able to reach him or get a response. Al Aab of Toronto (the father
of this mailing list) has a copy of sed16, so you may try writing to him. Al posted
on this mailing list not too long ago.
 
And as I write this, I just found an error in the HTML version of the sed FAQ,
right at section 7.  I guess my text-to-html script needs to be improved. If you
read the sedfaq.txt version, it looks right.  Back to the drawing board ...

I'm New to sed.
If I have a string variable called textstuff (ie. textstuff="abcdefg")
How do I use sed to remove
CR (Carriage Returns) and LF (Line Feeds)?
and how do you enter a control character, too?
Thanks.

Hi,

I would like to take your advise on how to improve my SED/AWK 
programming skills.

Are there good practice examples ?
Is there a tutorial to follow ?


Thanks to all,

I assume your variable is a variable of the shell?
to modify it with sed, you'd have to echo it, pipe it through sed,
and write the result in a file.

  echo $textstuff | sed SOME_TRANSFORMATION > SOME_FILE

> How do I use sed to remove

on Unix systems, I understand you want to remove newlines (\n) and 
also remove \r;
on MSDOS and windows system, I understand you want to remove all newlines, 
i.e. join all lines together.

if on Unix, removing \r is a matter of
  s/\r//g;  # GNUsed and other accepting this extension (refer to the FAQ) 
or
  s/^M//g;  # any sed, the ^M being a litteral \r character 

Now, joining all lines is done by:
  H;         # accumulate the line to the hold buffer
  $!d        # delete if not at the last line
  x;         # switch to the hold buffer
  s/\n//g;   # remove all embedded newlines
  
there will still be a trailing newline at the end of the big line.

putting it all together, it gives:

echo $textstuff | sed 's/^M//g;H;$!d;x;s/\n//g' > SOME_FILE

On the other hand, you can use the shell without using sed at all:

result=`echo $textstuff`
will transform  "a\nb  c" into "a b c"

to remove every control char except newline:
traditional sed, 7bit ascii:
  echo $textstuff | sed 's/[^ -~]//g' > SOME_FILE
POSIX sed:
  echo $textstuff | sed 's/[[:cntrl:]]//g' > SOME_FILE
On GNU sed and others, you can also represent any char in hexa
using \xdd notation, dd being two hexadecimal digits.
to remove newlines also, see other mail.

PS: I guess tr would be more efficient for want you want to do, 
but I don't know the tr syntax.

Nope.  The gsed matcher must stay the same as the one in GNU C library
(glibc).  Plus, ssed's does not yet handle multibyte character sets and full
support for these is one of the requirements for future versions of gsed
(note: this might hurt performance a bit, but not much).

glibc 2.3 has introduced a new matcher which is very complicated but also
POSIX compliant and faster when backreferences are not used.  Unluckily sed
uses them widely more than any other RE client I know of. :-(  If this
matcher was not introduced, it would have been feasible to work on MBCS
support and have the ssed matcher get into glibc (and hence gsed, gawk,
etc.).  But as things stand now, this does not have a single chance (for me
it would not be bad, but I'm not the one to decide -- ever heard about
Ulrich Drepper?)

I don't know because I don't have the source to BSD sed, but IIRC it uses
its own matcher just like ssed.

This is one optimization that glibc does.

It would try removing one character from aaaacccceeee and matching the b
against the last e, then against the penultimate, and so on until it sees
that b does not match even if [^b]* is the empty string, then it aborts.
The basic idea to implement * is

1) match as far as possible
2) recurse on the rest of the regexp, if it succeeds that's fine
3) remove a character and if empty, fail.  Else go to 2

Ah yes. gawk is much slower than other awks to in fact. For instance,
the other open source awk, mawk, is much faster.

The sed I have been toying with that I got from the OpenBSD sources
does use the RE matcher in the C library.

I see. So what you are doing is a kind of pattern analysis on the RE,
trying to find patterns like [^<a char>]*<a char>, so that it can
immediately tell that <a char> cannot exist in the beginning *-match?
I bet there are a lot of different such pattern optimizations possible.

hi paolo,

i think there's something wrong with ssed or my DOS, see:

C:\>echo "bla"
"bla"

C:\>echo "bla" | ssed "s/\"//g"
bla

C:\>echo "bla" | ssed "s/\"//g" > b
ssed: can't read >: Invalid argument
bla

C:\>echo "bla" | ssed "s/b//g" > b

C:\>


when escaping a quote inside the quotes AND using file
redirection, it's seems that ssed tries to read the '>'
file.

i'm sending this to the list to eric (the sed@DOS god :)
or any other experienced DOS user see if it's a DOS
specific issue.

bye!

i'm afraid not.
i've done more tests here, and with GNU sed 3.02.80 the
same command line works fine under DOS:

C:\>echo "bla" | sed "s/\"//g" > b

C:\>type b
bla

C:\>sed -V
GNU sed version 3.02.80

Subject: about the last giant "random thoughts" thread
Reply-To: aurelio@verde666.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Status:   

hi all,

unfortunely i couldn't join you on the thread i've created, but
i'm very impressed on how things ran fine and we had no flame
wars on a so critic issue: maintainer's work.

there was a lot of important issues discussed, with so valuable
content that i could not resist to store it on a readable form.
(It's History!)

i've passed the last days trying to get it all on a single
document (whenever boss was not seeing ;) and now i've
finished.

please, anybody interested on the GNU SED 4.x new commands
issue see this document:
http://verde666.org/sed/gsed4_random_thread.html


after all this talks, i'm pretty disapointed no conclusions
or pratical actions were made. it seems that paolo agreed
some commands were mistake/controversial, but not said they
will be gone, and laurent and bjrn are hacking other sed
versions to fit the "diet" need.

we've forked instead improving GNU SED?

again please, i beg you to re-read all that was discussed
and think about it one more time. there is nothing we can
do? GNU SED will continue as it is now? other seds will be
brought back from the dead to satisfy unhappy users?

i, aurelio, think the bjrn proposed solution is the best:
change GNU sed behaviour based on the calling name (just as
bash/sh and grep/fgrep/egrep), letting 'sed' to be the vanilla
sed, with no extra commands or fruits. then 'gsed', or 'ssed'
brings the full power, for those who want it.

paolo, do you think this is doable or acceptable?

(i'm sorry if i am bugging you, but i must confess i still
 use gsed 3.02 and don't have any will to upgrade - i feel
 bad about it, i don't want to stuck on this version :( )

aurelio

Yes, the problem is that the Windows version of ssed is not
stripping the quotes during parsing. Here are my results from
using CMD.EXE under Windows 2000.  My comments will be
intermixed with the command output, using **REM**

---begin console output---

Z:\>sed --version
super-sed version 3.59
based on GNU sed version 3.02.80
**REM**   [... deletion ...]

Z:\>gsed --version
GNU sed version 3.02.80
**REM**  [... deletion ...]

Z:\>ver

Microsoft Windows 2000 [Version 5.00.2195]


**REM**  How does plain DOS handle triple quotes ?  It
**REM**  passes '>one' to the console instead of redirecting.

Z:\>echo "one" | echo "xx\"yy" >one
"xx\"yy" >one


**REM**  A true DOS filter, FIND (not the Unix util), also
**REM**  does not handle triple quotes as arguments

Z:\>echo "one" | find "xx\"yy" >one
FIND: Parameter format not correct

Z:\>echo "one" | find "xx\"yy"
FIND: Parameter format not correct


**REM**  Now let's see what ssed and gsed do for this.
**REM**  Note that gsed parses the command line and creates
**REM**  the output file, while ssed does not.

Z:\>echo "two" | sed "s/\"/MATCH/" >two
sed: can't read >two: Invalid argument

Z:\>type two
The system cannot find the file specified.

Z:\>echo "thr" | gsed "s/\"/MATCH/" >thr

Z:\>type thr
MATCHthr"


**REM**  Okay, here is a true DOS/Windows secret. It is
**REM**  possible to place the redirection arrow first
**REM**  on the command line, before anything else, and
**REM**  then your commands will work.  Observe:

Z:\>echo "fou" | >fou  sed "s/\"/MATCH/"

Z:\>type fou
MATCHfou"

Z:\>echo "fiv" | >fiv  gsed "s/\"/MATCH/"

Z:\>type fiv
MATCHfiv"


**REM**  And here is a sed secret. gsed v3.02.80 for Windows
**REM**  accepts Unix-style 'single and "double" quoting' on
**REM**  the command-line. Must have been compiled with DJGPP.

Z:\>echo "six" | sed 's/\"/MATCH/'
sed: -e expression #1, char 1: Unknown command: `''

Z:\>echo "sev" | gsed 's/\"/MATCH/'
MATCHsev"


**REM**  So your solution is either to put the file redirection
**REM**  arrow in FRONT of the sed command, as in example "fou"
**REM**  above, or else to use the sed \xHH syntax which allows
**REM**  you to use \x22 to represent a double-quote mark.

Z:\>echo "ei8" | sed "s/\x22/MATCH/"
MATCHei8"

Z:\>echo "ni9" | gsed "s/\x22/MATCH/"
MATCHni9"

---end console output-----

I believe you will get similar results regardless of whether
you use COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE under Windows 2000. For myself,
I prefer 4DOS or 4NT (the power of a Unix shell without Unix),
but that's a commercial solution from http://www.jpsoft.com.
Hope the examples above explain what's happening.

Subject: help with sed
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

can this be solved with sed?

short summary- 
I'm reading a text file by cat'ing each line and For each line of text 
I'm reading, I'm checking the individual fields of each line and doing 
character substutions while echoing out each line to an output file.

Here's my challenge - if a field within a line contains a certain 
string of characters then I do not want to echo out this line to the 
output file but still continue reading each subsequent input line.  
each output line should be followed by a CR(carriage return, 0x0D) and 
a LF(Line feed, 0x0A).  I'm missing the LF after each line.  Can't 
figure out why?

Any suggestions? thanks.

   I also have stayed out of this discussion, simply because I tend
to be verbose and probably give my opinions to others too strongly
or more than I should.  I prefer to listen and hear what others are
saying (and wanting), at least so far.  Where I have expertise, I
am glad to share it with anyone. As the maintainer of the sed FAQ,
I try not to intrude my personal prejudices into the text.

   But I also do have some thoughts on the development of sed, and
before everything goes away, I'd like to post my reflections.

   This is a valuable service to the programming community, and
I'm glad you compiled it. Really!!

   After the talk about sed "bloat", I must say that I still do
not understand why you want sed to revert to an earlier version
with fewer features. Here are my thoughts on the idea of 'bloat':

  (1) Bloat is a problem if it increases filesize or program
execution beyond the expectations of most users. I have used
computers since the early 1980s, with a 2.5 mHz CP/M Kaypro.
I did tech support for our CP/M and PC computers, and filesize
was an issue when one or two floppy disks had to carry your most
essential utilities for fixing or examining other computers. At
90 kilobytes or so, gsed or ssed are still within acceptable
limits for my uses.

   But what about performance in terms of speed, etc.? On my
DOS/Windows machines, I don't see any perceptible difference
between the old sed (HHsed v1.5) and the latest gsed/ssed. My
need as an end-user is for sed to handle large files and long
lines, and to give me flexible power and quick response. Sed
executes in a *blink of an eye*, so long as you know how to
write regular expressions that don't require too much
backtracking. I'm not denying that there have been optimizations
and changes (plus or minus); what I'm saying is that one-tenth
of a second faster or slower isn't perceptible to me.

  (2) Bloat is a problem if new features break old scripts.
>From my point of view, virtually none of the "new" features will
break old scripts. The /e and /W switches to the s/// command,
the new command-line switches (-i, -u), and the \L, \U, and other
escape sequences in the right-hand-side of a s/// command would
virtually NEVER be put in a legacy sed script. If the additions
to GNU sed (such as "/pattern/, +5" or BEGIN~STEP in ranges) would
be likely to conflict with older sed scripts, you might have a
case, but what legacy sed scripts would conflict with these?

   And on the same point, I rarely use legacy scripts anyway. I
write the scripts I need, and if I should occasionally visit the
sed-users Grabbag (legacy headquarters!), none of those scripts
fail to run in the latest GNU sed.

  (3) Bloat is a problem if creeping-featuritis makes it difficult
to learn or want to learn a program. If the learning curve is too
great or if there are too many options, I'll tend to look elsewhere
for my solution. For example, I abandoned WebMake and switched to
htmlpp (both are perl-based HTML preprocessors), even though WebMake
is probably more powerful, simply because I was unable to learn it.
A few years ago, I spent a couple of days looking at PDGREPPE as a
replacement for GNU grep (http://isvs.tripod.com/ref/pdgiindx.htm),
only to decide that the enormous multitude of options was not only
idiosyncratic but confusing. The documentation was garbled, and I
figured my time would be better spent learning Perl and installing
tcgrep (Tom Christiansen's supercharged grep; a big Perl script).

   GNU sed is nowhere near the PDGREPPE stage, and the fact is, its
extensions are consistent with other GNU tools.

   Like you, I ask myself, "Do I need these new features?"  To use
a live example, Do I need to upgrade to 4DOS version 7.5 while I'm
currently using 4DOS version 6.02?  So far, I haven't upgraded because
I don't expect the additional functions to be worth the $57 it will
cost me to upgrade. I haven't upgraded to Info Select version 7 either,
because the cost of the upgrade ($100) doesn't offset the additional
functions I will receive. But for me, these are price-versus-features
decisions. If the upgrades were free, then I would absolutely upgrade.

   In short, I have lived through GNU sed's changes since HHsed 1.5
was the only version I knew of, and the changes in size are tolerable;
the changes in speed are imperceptible; the changes in syntax are
backward-compatible (well, in those days "+", not "\+", meant 1 or more);
and the additional features are learnable. (I had to make that last word
end in "ble".)

   That's all I have to say about "bloat", but I do have more to say.

   The Unix/Linux programming wizards here (and I am not one!) represent
a different "way" of using sed than I am used to. This mailing list was
started by Al Aab of Toronto maybe 7 years ago. I was on the very first
round of mailing when it began as a big CC: list of personal email.

   Al and I come from the DOS world. I spent years in the alt.msdos.batch
news group on Usenet, and sed was the best solution to a ton of questions
that came up repeatedly there. What kind of things do DOS batch file users
often want to do?  It was up to Timo Salmi to put together the default FAQ
for that newsgroup, and sed solves a lot of questions far more easily than
any pure-DOS solutions. The fact that sed exists as one small file, smaller
than awk, is strongly in its favor---even though awk is an all-purpose answer
for a wider range of DOS-related questions.

   What do DOS users often want to do? They want to change the case of
strings, and they want to pull the Nth word or the first N words from
a line. This, of course, can be done by awk, but the facility for doing
this in sed is why I cheer the appearance of sedmod and sed16. I love
the addition of the \L, \U, and \E escape characters in GNU sed, and
I also appreciate the $1, $2, ... and $n tokens in sed16. Yes, it's a
new feature, but I've also heard SO MANY requests to be able to easily
pull out the Nth word in a string.  And frankly, I don't want to direct
people always to awk. Sed16 will give them the 4nd word quickly ("s/.*/$4/")
with a fairly intuitive syntax.

   I can agree that sedmod/sed16, and ssed, and GNU sed ought to keep
separate directions and separate command names. Anyway, it's midnight
and the library is closing now, so I gotta run. Thanks for your patience
and understanding. I have my prejudices and focuses, like anyone else.
I just try to keep in mind the desires of the DOS user besides the Unix
users as well. Take care!!

Well I don't know what Bjrn is doing exactly, but as for me:

1) as a new sed addict I'm subject to fits of programming
too complexe things in sed just for fun (like esoteric
languages...) and for this I need a *fast* POSIX sed.

2) I happen to own a macintosh laptop dating back to 1992,
(4 MB RAM, 33MHz 680x0) which I still use when travelling,
with minix on it, and I can assure you I'm not even considering
compiling GNU sed to it (or even GNU whatever to it) as
experience has told me that whenever a utility has 'GNU' in it,
the features in it almost always come with a too high price.

Generally speaking, GNU software considers that memory is
unlimited, that the only compiler is GCC (alloca, ...),
that ints are 4 bytes long (not the best choice on my old
68000 - slows down almost every integer operations by a
factor 2), ...

For GNU sed, if even running the same script on old, limited
hhsed and on the newest GNU sed 4.0.5 takes seven times longer
in gsed than on hhsed, then there is no reason why removing
extensions in GNU sed would make it run any faster.

The other 'feature' GNU sed has, is that you can use it
to patch binary programs (because NULs in strings are allowed
and because lines can be arbitrarily long). Again this is
not a feature for me if I want to run it on a small machine
where memory is *not* unlimited (hence there is no need to
bother allowing NULs in lines - besides, POSIX allows a sed
implementation to not support NULs).

All this to say, that even if GNU sed should remove all its
extensions, would I still toy with my own expanded hhsed.

and the fact I'm 'forking' as you say is beneficial to
GNU sed too, as in debugging my sed I can submit bug
reports to Paolo - ask him :-)

Unix/Linux system, that you are using a shell script to cycle

the shell script, and that you want to produce DOS textfiles
on a Unix filesystem.

Of course, these are things that I have to guess at, since you
didn't say in particular.  Tell us what filesystem you are using
and post the shell script (or batch file) that you have now. If
it were me working on a Unix system, I'd output the file as a
Unix one (LF = newline), and then run a Unix-to-DOS converter
or script to normalize the line endings after the output file
was created.

i didn't want to put my name on that page, because it's a
"community page". but now i see that broken links or even
addings could be prejudiced if the user don't know who's
the contact.

thank you. i've fixed that.

Thank you very much!
fixed.

(mmmm, i think it's best to download all docs and keep a
local copy - TODO)


Now that its time to change the page, i've done more TODO
items, which are:

- added document: An introduction to sed

- added script: unlambda.sed (link and colorized)

- changed SED FAQ and 1liners url to the new ones (@sf)

- update ssed source link to v3.60

hi,

1) first there is no point of contact indicated in sed.sf.net,
so I'm posting here.

2) the folowing links are broken:

  http://www.dbnet.ece.ntua.gr/~george/sed/sedql.html
  http://www.dbnet.ece.ntua.gr/~george/sed/sed.logic.txt
  http://www.dbnet.ece.ntua.gr/~george/sed/sed-microcode.html

but apparently the pages are still available at the addresses
obtained when filtering the three lines above through:

  sed 's,/sed/,/sed/OLD/,g'

3) somebody told us (Paulo?) that sed16 would be uploaded on
sed.sf.net, but I couldn't find it.

regards,

Laurent

You can use grep to filter out the lines you don't want
cat file | grep -v pattern or use use sed:
cat file | sed "/pattern/d"
You can use \r or \n to match and replace line feeds and and carriage
returns. (I always forget which comes first in the windows world.)

Let me clear up this.  The comments are regarding the future 4.1 version, 
of which I hope to release a beta soon (will be named 4.0a).  I hope you
don't think I am abusing my role as gsed maintainer -- indeed I did change
my mind about some things as a result from the thread.

I am not going to turn this into another giant thread, but of course feel
free to reply and give me your opinion.  I'm asking however to avoid
reinstating what people said in other posts, and to avoid making the
thread too deep.  This will make this message and the replies more useful
to me and to my users (that is, you).

- 'L' will not be gone before 4.2
  Also because I don't intend to make another 4.0 release, so I can
  deprecate L in 4.1 but not remove it.

  I'm going to do the same in ssed as well.  ssed and gsed are not
  going to have any difference but the RE matcher.

- 'e' will not go away.  Sorry.  :-)

- $1, $2, ... will never be included.  They have serious backwards
  incompatibility problems and implementing them is not the easiest
  thing to do.

- I doubt 1,3-4,7- options in the 's' command will be implemented soon,
  but mostly for laziness.  I do think it is an extension which is worth
  being considered, and will put it into the TODO list.

- I doubt \= will be ever implemented, but I am not absolutely negative.

- I doubt more commands will be ever implemented, but I am not
  absolutely negative.

- POSIXLY_CORRECT behavior will disable \l \L \u \U \E.  Not because
  of popular request :-) but because it is the right thing to do (it
  is no different from disabling \t and the like).

- 'v' will override POSIXLY_CORRECT behavior.  This makes it more useful.

- I am going to think much more about generating backups with GNU-style
  filenames.  The implementation is clumsy because of backwards
  compatibility (if I really wanted to do this, I should have taken a look
  at the command line options for patch; now it is too late and besides
  things are simpler as they are now).

  IOW, this feature will 99% be removed.

- -i will stay.  I think that sed is different enough from ed that -i
  does fit in the picture.  -s will stay because it does not cost
  anything to implement it.

- I *might* consider if there is enough request disabling extended
  commands in POSIXLY_CORRECT mode.  v will be left there to enable
  other extended commands.

  Anyway, Eric is right saying that new commands and options are not
  backwards incompatible, and they make older seds abort.  OTOH escapes
  make older seds spit out incorrect results.

- The command will still be named sed.  If you want to have a bare bones
  sed, you can use the scriptlet that I posted (I advise against
  enabling POSIXLY_CORRECT behavior globally).

Does the whole issue go away if one just puts a bash shell on their Windows
machine ( cygwin <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/index.html>  is on mine,
& Im using Win2000), and uses the sed versions compatible with unix/linux?

Yes, the problem is that the Windows version of ssed is not
stripping the quotes during parsing. Here are my results from
using CMD.EXE under Windows 2000.  My comments will be
intermixed with the command output, using **REM**

---begin console output---

Z:\>sed --version
super-sed version 3.59
based on GNU sed version 3.02.80
**REM**   [... deletion ...]

Z:\>gsed --version
GNU sed version 3.02.80
**REM**  [... deletion ...]

Z:\>ver

Microsoft Windows 2000 [Version 5.00.2195]


**REM**  How does plain DOS handle triple quotes ?  It
**REM**  passes '>one' to the console instead of redirecting.

Z:\>echo "one" | echo "xx\"yy" >one
"xx\"yy" >one


**REM**  A true DOS filter, FIND (not the Unix util), also
**REM**  does not handle triple quotes as arguments

Z:\>echo "one" | find "xx\"yy" >one
FIND: Parameter format not correct

Z:\>echo "one" | find "xx\"yy"
FIND: Parameter format not correct


**REM**  Now let's see what ssed and gsed do for this.
**REM**  Note that gsed parses the command line and creates
**REM**  the output file, while ssed does not.

Z:\>echo "two" | sed "s/\"/MATCH/" >two
sed: can't read >two: Invalid argument

Z:\>type two
The system cannot find the file specified.

Z:\>echo "thr" | gsed "s/\"/MATCH/" >thr

Z:\>type thr
MATCHthr"


**REM**  Okay, here is a true DOS/Windows secret. It is
**REM**  possible to place the redirection arrow first
**REM**  on the command line, before anything else, and
**REM**  then your commands will work.  Observe:

Z:\>echo "fou" | >fou  sed "s/\"/MATCH/"

Z:\>type fou
MATCHfou"

Z:\>echo "fiv" | >fiv  gsed "s/\"/MATCH/"

Z:\>type fiv
MATCHfiv"


**REM**  And here is a sed secret. gsed v3.02.80 for Windows
**REM**  accepts Unix-style 'single and "double" quoting' on
**REM**  the command-line. Must have been compiled with DJGPP.

Z:\>echo "six" | sed 's/\"/MATCH/'
sed: -e expression #1, char 1: Unknown command: `''

Z:\>echo "sev" | gsed 's/\"/MATCH/'
MATCHsev"


**REM**  So your solution is either to put the file redirection
**REM**  arrow in FRONT of the sed command, as in example "fou"
**REM**  above, or else to use the sed \xHH syntax which allows
**REM**  you to use \x22 to represent a double-quote mark.

Z:\>echo "ei8" | sed "s/\x22/MATCH/"
MATCHei8"

Z:\>echo "ni9" | gsed "s/\x22/MATCH/"
MATCHni9"

---end console output-----

I believe you will get similar results regardless of whether
you use COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE under Windows 2000. For myself,
I prefer 4DOS or 4NT (the power of a Unix shell without Unix),
but that's a commercial solution from http://www.jpsoft.com.
Hope the examples above explain what's happening.

That's because ssed Win32 builds are built with Mingw32 (i.e. the
Microsoft C runtime library, MSVCRT.DLL) which exhibits the same
behavior as other C commands.  If I had them built with Cygwin,
I would gain...

...these, and also a 900 kb runtime DLL :-)

Give us a specific example of a line, and how you want it
transformed. Also, tell us which kind of system you are on, and we
will be able to give better help.

I think so too. It is very valuable to collect all these thoughts
into one document.

I am not going to comment yet again on the points below where I've
already given my opinion.

But Eric does not address what is, IMO, a very important point, namely
that of portability. The more features GNU sed has, the more difficult
it is to use it to write a script that will run reliably on other
systems.

I think I should be able to have gsed as the only sed on my machine,
use it to write a script, move that script to another system and be
reasonably sure that it will run on that system. I am not talking
about another Linux system or DOS here, I am talking about other Unix
platforms, that typically have a legacy or POSIX sed.

This is the same problem as with bash/sh. It is very common on Linux
systems, where bash is used as sh, to find Bourne shell scripts with
"bashisms" in them. Scripts that /will not run/ on other Unices. That
is why Debian for instance is moving towards using ash as sh, to
ensure that the system scripts are sh-compliant. (For those who may
not now, sh is the standard system shell. The original was called
Bourne shell after its author. sh is the least common denominator in
Unix shells, so portable scripts is usually written in it.)

It was interesting to read Eric's post froma DOS user's
perspective. And indeed, I could be wrong here, but it seems to me
like some of the gsed features are catering more specifically to DOS
users, to compensate for not having a powerful shell to work in. For
example, the last time I used DOS there were no easy way to write
command line for-loops. Personally, I cannot say that I like this
development. Of course I want gsed to be as useful to DOS users as it
is to users of GNU systems, but the loyalities of gsed must lie in
fitting in well in the GNU operating system for obvious reasons.

Personally, I'm leaning towards having BSD sed as my default system
sed. I have ported it sucessfully (I believe) to Linux. (Not much of a
port, only a few lines needed to be changed.) I will probably
keep GNU sed around as gsed though. Maybe I will eventually try to
improve on BSD sed and distribute the result.

I don't need sed to be 'everything'. For that I have awk, sh, tr,
etc. I only need sed to be sed. And I want my mental image of sed be
that of a portable, POSIX sed, so that when I write scripts I can be
sure that I write them portably, so that they run on Solaris or AIX or
BSD, etc.

...because the culprit is the RE matcher.

Re. sizeof(int) == 4, I think this is true for 99% of the Unix
programs that have been distributed in the last 5 years (and
maybe more...)

There are many places where POSIX cripples itself to make old
Unices comply (at least in the system utilities documents).

Sven and Michael have given the best books for sed and awk
and online reference for sed.  For awk you can get an electronic
copy of "Effective awk Programming" from

<url:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23617&release_id=4
9017>

Scroll down to gawk and download the ~5Mb documentation. It
is in various formats: pdf, windows hlp, etc..

I need to read a file like the one below and add ,usrquota,grpquota

How can this be done with sed or is there a better way

You can try it:

$ cat file | sed '/\/home/s/defaults/&,usrquota,grpquota/'

Sed is the right tool for that.
if you're sure that any '/home' found in the file is the mount point
(i.e. you're sure you don't have a /dev/home or something) and if you're
sure that 'defaults' is the right field (i.e. you don't have a '/defaults'
mount point or a '/dev/defaults' devices), then a simple
  /\/home/s/defaults/&,usrquota,grpquota/
would do the trick. In english it means:
  /\/home/      if '/home' is found in the line
  s/defaults/   replace 'defaults' by
  &             the string to be replaced (i.e. defaults)
  ,usrquota,grpquota/   followed by ',usrquota,grpquota'

(the complete shell command would be something like:

  cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
  sed '/\/home/s/defaults/&,usrquota,grpquota/' /etc/fstab.bak > /etc/fstab

If now you're paranoid and want to guard against
  /def/defaults     /local/home      ext3    noauto        1 2
being wrongly modified in
  /def/defaults,usrquota,grpquota    /local/home      ext3    noauto
1 2
you would have to explicitely make sure /home and defaults are in the
right fields, for instance:

  s/^\([^ ]*  /home  *[^ ][^ ]*  *defaults\) /\1,usrquota,grpquota /
if the field are separated with spaces only. If the fields can be separated
by spaces and tabs also, it goes messy, and you should have a look
at gnu sed extensions representing any white char. (the POSIX portable way
is too ugly and I won't mention it unless asked for it).

incidentally..
i keep info on good/interesting/useful programs
in a huge file which i can also use as signatures.
i usually append a signature with info when i am posting
to a public forum such as mailing lists and newsgroups.

maybe this info is of use for you, too.  here is the address:

www.guckes.net/sig/SIGS

and if you want to know how i add a signature
to my messages then take a look at this page:
www.guckes.net/agrep/

have fun!

Subject: bug on GNU sed?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=Windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

While testing my work-in-progress sed derived from hhsed, I developped
a small bug-o-matic tool (a small awk program that generates random SED 
expressions) and I'm running the random sed expressions it produces on
both my sed, and GNU sed 4.0.5, to check my implementation against
the GNU one taken as a reference.

This bug-o-matic tool is extra: I foung two bugs on my sed in
two minutes, and I found some weird behaviours in gnu sed too:

  echo '' | sed -n 's/a*/b/2'
(loops forever)
  echo '' | sed -n 's/^a*/b/2'
(loops forever)
  echo 'z' | sed -n 's/^a*/b/2p'
  z
(prints 'z', whereas I would expect it to print nothing!)
  echo 'z' | sed -n 's/a*/b/3p'
  zb
(prints 'zb', whereas I would expect it to print nothing)

This was found just at the second try of the silly tool. I wonder
what a more extensive testing would reveal...

regards,
Laurent

Thank you very much.  These look like bugs in sed, not in the matcher.

There's a (very) small probability that they're fixed in 4.0.6.

If you've a POSIX tr then:

echo $textstuff | tr -d '[:ctrl:]'

deletes all control characters

Whew! Good job! :-)

It would be interesting to check the cache behavior of ssed (might have more
icache misses because the code is bigger) and trying a more recent ssed that
does the Boyer-Moore stuff.

BTW, what is this gse 3.48? On the official download loactions I can
only find GNU sed 3.0(1|2) in the 3-series.

Also, some people have mentioned version 3.02.80, which is also not
available from the offical locations.

I can't find it anymore, but I guess it is super sed.
newer versions can be found at Eric Pement's page (3.59 and 3.60)
(which is the first found when looking for sed 3.48 on google)

  http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/

but unfortulately Eric does not point to the official home pages for
these versions of sed...

It also looks like  the link:
  http://www.itribe.net/virtunix/gnused.zip
for gsed 1.03 is broken. If it is the same as the sed 1.3 written by
Eric S. Raymond, I can provide a link or even the archive if needed.

   I believe I provide the official home pages on the sed FAQ:

   http://sed.sourceforge.net/sedfaq2.html#s2.2.1.1

   But if you know of better URLs than these, I'll be glad to add
them or modify the FAQ for version 016. And for my personal home
page on sed (http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/), the
link to precomiled ssed v3.59 points directly to Paolo's page at
sourceforge, not to a local version at Northpark. I used to provide
a local copy of ssed at Northpark because there were many timeout
problems when ssed was downloaded from spazioweb in Italy.

   The itribe.net website is closed, as I noted in the latest version
of the sed FAQ (http://sed.sourceforge.net/sedfaq2.html#s2.2.1.3).
This is a very different version of sed than Eric Raymond's version
of sed 1.3, which is available here:

       http://catb.org/~esr/sed-1.3.tar.gz

HTH.

Subject: sed bugs? (second batch)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=Windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   


Paulo,

Here is the second batch of bugs raised by the bug-o-matic. Il looks
like they're all related to the way GNU sed handles null 
sub-expressions, either repeated or not... I let you forward this 
to the right forum if the bug relates to the glibc matcher.

doing:
  echo 'abcd' | gsed405 's/^\(a*\)*/<&>/' ; echo $?
takes some time and returns:
  128
instead of the logical:
  <a>bcd
  0
returned by ssed360 and my sed.
  
(actually the sample generated by the bug-o-matic is:
echo 'd\\\\c' | sed -n \
's/^[a-ca-c]*\(\/\{0,9\}\(\)\2*\)\2\1[^]]\{1,70\}/\2\\\2\\\1a\2\1/p'
but I tried to produce a smaller sample that exhibits strange
behaviour.)

--

doing:
  echo 'abcd' | gsed405 -n 's/E*\(\(\)\2*b*\)/\1!/p'
correctly produces
  !abcd
but
  echo 'abcd' | gsed405 -n 's/E*\(\(\)\2*b*\2*\)/\1!/p'
prints nothing and returns 128

---

yet another one. doing:
  echo 'abbbbc' | gsed405 -n 's/\(b\{2\}\(C*\)\)\1\2/<&>/p'
correctly produces:
  a<bbbb>cd
but:
  echo 'abbbbc' | gsed405 -n 's/\(b\{2\}\(C*\)\)\2\1/<&>/p'
results in a segmentation fault. The variant:
  echo 'abbbbc' | gsed405 -n 's/\(b\(C*\)\)\2\1/<&>/p' ; echo $?
fails to match but return 0, and the variant:
  echo 'abbbbc' | gsed405 -n 's/\(bb\(C*\)\)\2\1/<&>/p'
dumps core as with b\{2\}

That's it for tonight. Best regards, and I apologize again 
for reporting so many bugs :-)

Laurent

Oh ok. Since it was called "gsed", I assumed that it was an official
release of GNU sed.

I already have the sed 1.3 source that is available from Eric
Raymond's hoime page, but thanks anyway.

Ok, here's the patch to fix it.

BTW, try this on your sed:

echo 'abc' | sed 's/a*/b/g'

should yield xbxcx.  This is a bad beast, it was fixing this that introduced
the infinite loops.  The other were due to a misinterpretation -- I executed
the p/e/w options if the regex matched once, not the given number of times.

I'll include the tests in future versions.

You mean it should yield 'bbbcb', right? In that case, BSD sed gets it
right, but GNU sed 3.02 yields 'bbbbcb' (four b's).

Subject: What says POSIX on labels?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Status:   

I was compiling glibc, and in there there is a sed script
(po2text.sed) of the form:

/.../{
        ...
        ta
        ...
:a
        ...
        ta
}
/.../{
        ...
        ta
        ...
:a
        ...
        ta
}

The BSD sed I was using complained of several appearences of the 'a'
label. This implies that the scope for labels is file global. Since
glibc is usually compiled using GNU tools, I have to suspect that the
scope for labels in GNU sed is the containg block. Now I am interested
to know what POSIX says, if anything, about this. Which sed is right?

AFAICR POSIX says nothing about label scope one way or the other.  Most
seds that I have used don't support "block scoping".

Simplest solution with a POSIX tr:

$ tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' <infile >outfile # go to all upper

$ tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' <infile >outfile # go to all lower

this looks plain wrong to me. POSIX does not tell anything about label
scope, so I suppose one should consider that the scope is global.
however, POSIX regretfully allows 'a' and 'a ' (a followed by a space)
to be two different labels (a text in the rationale section expalins that
though this is not what the POSIX guys would have chosen, they had to
because otherwise a number of legacy scripts would break).

It seemed very strange to me too. So, in this sense the glibc script
is erroneus. I guess the reason it hasn't been discovered is that
glibc is always built using GNU sed. It is kind of strange that GNU
sed behaves like this I think.

Wow, that is fascinating. Who would choose to use both "a" and "a " as
labels in a script. Talk about confusing.

No, I think that if it works it is only by chance.  I'll complain to the glibc 
folks.

I'm afraid I still disagree with your implementation. Let's see:
1) $ echo 'abc' | gsed406p1 's/b*/x/1'
   xabc
2) $ echo 'abc' | gsed406p1 's/b*/x/2'
   axc
3) $ echo 'abc' | gsed406p1 's/b*/x/3'
   abxc
4) $ echo 'abc' | gsed406p1 's/b*/x/4'
   abcx

To me, 1 and 2 are OK, 3 and 4 are wrong, and the reason is,
that (as you say) when doing s/b*/x/g only three 'x' are in 
the final result: 
g) $ echo 'abc' | gsed406p1 's/b*/x/g'
   xaxcx
So why should you then match four different times when
matching one number at a time, but only match three different
times when matching globally?

To me, it should be:

3) $ echo 'abc' | sed 's/b*/x/3'
   abcx
4) $ echo 'abc' | sed 's/b*/x/4'
   abc
(i.e. no match for /4)

It does since I saw this in gnu/testsuite.

well, the patch you submitted does not solve the second batch 
of bugs I sent you. Anyway I fail to see how infinite loops occurring
while trying to match /\(a*\)*/ should be related to the 
improper handling of the /N or /g flag, contrary to what 
you apparently are saying here.

Laurent

Interesting. BSD sed gets these wrong too. I tested them on the sed
that comes with Solaris, and got the following results:

d95-bli@knatte:~> echo 'abc' | /bin/sed 's/b*/x/1'
xabc
d95-bli@knatte:~> echo 'abc' | /bin/sed 's/b*/x/2'
axc
d95-bli@knatte:~> echo 'abc' | /bin/sed 's/b*/x/3'
abcx
d95-bli@knatte:~> echo 'abc' | /bin/sed 's/b*/x/4'
abc

Seems like the correct way to me.

option -r,
the equivalent of dc and unlambda use the same time in the ERE version than
in
traditional, BRE version.
(I used the following script to convert from BRE to ERE - disclaimer: it is
untested except on dc.sed and unlambda.sed)

On Solaris you have tested against /bin/sed.  It might be better to
test /usr/xpg4/bin/sed (the SUS/POSIX compliant one).

Subject: joining lines
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I have a file that has names, addresses and city/state/zip. Each line 
of text has a blank line after it, & there is an additional blank 
line between each set of 3 lines of text. What i'm trying to do is 
turn each set of 3 lines of text into 1 line(record), with a pipe as 
the delimeter. Geting rid of ALL blank lines is easy enough, but 
turning each set of 3 lines into one is proving to be a problem for 
me.
Here is an example of what the file looks like:
John Doe

123 Main St

Anytown, CT 06203


Mickey Mouse

11223 132nd Ave

Anaheim, CA 91004


Alfred E Neumann

47 Ironic Drive

Intercourse, PA 09342


The desired end result is:
John Doe|123 Main St|Anytown, CT 06203
Mickey Mouse|11223 Main St|Anaheim, CA 91004
Alfred E Neumann|47 Ironic Drive|Intercourse, PA 09342

Any help would be appreciated.

I have the notion that something like

sed /start,end/p myfile

should display myfile from the line containing "start" to the line
containing "end"

but that doesn't work.  Can this be done?

hi paolo,

i've updated the http://verde666.org/sed/gsed4_random_thread.html
document with this e-mail from you, to finish it.

i'm happy you made it very clear to understand.
i'm still not happy with gsed4, but i don't wanna discuss it
anymore and will let you do your maintainer job in peace :)

thanks!

Yes, they have no effect after the script has been compiled.

Subject: print similar lines
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

how to print only those lines that are similar or matching
between two files ?

i think sed should be able to find common lines between two
files. 

i tried the unix diff command also, but it prints the
line number and number of characters that are same. 
i think sed should have some elegant way to do this.

Try comm (for matching lines).

No, sed is very limited (by design) when it comes to handling input from more 
than one file.

I'm not so sure. Or rather, I do believe they make good test beds, but
they are not benchmarking sed under common situations. Both dc.sed and
unlambda.sed are characterized by having (typically) small inputs,
whereas the script itself is large. In contrast, most common uses of
sed have a small script operating on large input volumes. I think it
would be nice to come up with a good test for benchmarking operation
on large input volumes as well, in addition to dc and unlambda. I
still think that dc and unlambda are good tests, but another one could
be useful.

(I'm sorry I keep replying to you directly as well as to the
list. When I send a follow-up from my reader (Gnus), it automatically
sets the to-field to the sender of the mail I'm replying to, and the
cc-field to the mailing list, and sometimes other people's personal
address. I often forget to manually change it, so that my reply only
goes to the list.

I find this behaviour quite annoying, and I wish that the mailing list
mails would have their from-field set to the mailing list, so that a
reply will go back to the list. I guess I could program Gnus to do
this automatically for me as well, but I haven't had the time to yet.)

I meant that their weird regexes are good testbeds for the BRE->ERE conversion 
script.  unlambda and especially dc are not good benchmarks for seds, they 
tend to show extreme behavior rather than typical one.

I must find the time to do a procmail recipe to fix the absurd behavior of 
this mailing list.

Oh, I see. I misunderstood you. Then I agree with you. In addition, I
think dc and unlambda are good scripts for testing that the
functionality of a sed is correct too.

They don't test, however, all commands, don't have 8-bit characters, and don't 
test s/// options heavily (especially NUM and g, but also others).

lucky you that have programable mail readers or procmail...

i do use Yahoo! Webmail by choice, it fits all my needs. but
sed-users is the only list that is hard to do a simple Reply.

unfortunely the list manager is not the kind of guy who
cares about others opinions...

"use mutt" is his default answer to this problem.

I always assumed that since this is a Yahoogroups group, it isn't
possible for the list manager to change this behaviour. If indeed it
is possible to change it, I urge him to reconsider.

yahoo groups are not as flexible as mailman to manage lists, but
it has the most used features. this one we're talking is on:

  Management
    -> Group Settings (Messages)
      -> Posting and Archives (Edit)
        -> Posting Options
          -> Reply-to (All members, Sender, Group owner, Unsubscribe)

i have individual files that look like below. 
what i need to look for is a keyword ,say like Exchange in 
each of these files, and get a list of such files that
contain the keyword.
the keyword "Exchange" can occur anywhere in the file, but to
be precise it should be occuring after the "Service :" field.

First of all, can the keyword appear in other places where it should
not be counted? If so, special care must be taken to ensure that it
only happens after 'Service:'. If not, the easiest thing to do is a
shell loop:

for f in *
do
    grep -q ': Exchange' $f && echo $f
done

This will print the names of all files that match. Note that I am
greping for ': Exchange'. This could help in not having to bother with
making sure it is after 'Service', if ': Exchange' only appears at the
valid location.

Subject: RE: search for a keyword amongst files
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

In reply to Brian Dell's request:

> the keyword "Exchange" can occur anywhere in the file, but to

   I notice that the general solution is indeed to use grep -l to list
files that contain the string "Exchange", but so far there have been
no replies to the more particular question of how list only those
files which contain "Exchange" somewhere after "Service :". These two
solutions show how:

   perl -0777 -ne 'print "$ARGV\n" if /Service :.*Exchange/s' files*

   awk 'BEGIN{RS="\f"}; 
        FNR==1 && /Service :.*Exchange/{print FILENAME}' files*

   In the perl command, the leading switch character is a zero (0),
not a capital oh (O); 0777 makes Perl slurp the whole file at once.
Also in Perl, the dot metacharacter does not match a newline by
default, so the /s switch must be added to the /pattern/ to enable the
matching engine to cross newline boundaries. In awk and sed, the dot
metacharacter _does_ match any newlines in the pattern space.

   Likewise with awk, setting RS (record separator) to "\f" (formfeed,
Ctrl-L) or to "\a" (alert, Ctrl-G) will virtually guarantee that the
entire file will be slurped into a single record. Since the input
files are small, this is no problem. The 'FNR==1' (the Record Number
of this File) makes awk cycle through all the files individually,
printing the FILENAME of each file which contains the string. Without
FNR==1, awk would combine all the files and print only the FILENAME of
the last file which matched successfully.

   I was not able to find a solution in sed and shell, due to my lack
of familiarity with Unix shell scripting. I did find a solution with
ssed and 4DOS (in one line no less!), but that's probably not useful
to many other people. The basic idea, however, is to slurp the whole
file and search for the combined string. HTH.

they also are only written in traditional sed, not modern POSIX sed,
so they don't used \{n,m\} features, or repeated sub-expressions \(...\)*,
for instance. I chose them simply because there are (short) input for
these programs that generate output in a finite, but very long, time.
(the short input allows me to publish the benchmark script easily on
this mailing list).

Eric's sed page

http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/index.htm

covers a number of alternatives to sed.  Including
minitrue which I use from time to time.

Bjorn,

Thanks.  I still don't understand.  Given this file

C:\Temp\#\!>type 2.txt
one one
one two
one three
two one
two two
two three
three one
three two
three three

I would expect "sed -n /^one/,/^two/p 2.txt" to display the first 4 lines,
but here's what I get:

C:\Temp\#\!>sed -n /^one/,/^two/p 2.txt
one one
one two
one three
two one
three one
three two

Also, I really want to be able to specify the white space and the second
word as well, and am having no luck.  No records are printed by

sed -n /^one\s+o/,/^two\s+o/p 2.txt

although I was hoping for the first 4.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks,
Peter

Most seds don't support \s to represent whitespace.
Try:

sed -n '/^one[[:blank:]]\+o/,/^two[[:blank:]]\+o/p' 2.txt

what you did wrong, was to either omit quoting, or use Windows cmd.exe:

  C:\> echo /^one/,/^two/
  /one/,/two/
  C:\> echo "/^one/,/^two/"
  "/^one/,/^two/"
  C:\> echo '/^one/,/^two/' 
  '/one/,/two/'
  C:\> echo /^^one/,/^^two/
  /^one/,/^two/
  
I suppose sed implementations running on windows do themselves the
job of filtering any " left by the broken "-quoting of cmd.exe, so
the good bet would be, on Windows, to use 

  C:\> sed -n "/^one/,/^two/p" 2.txt

traditional way of specifying space: " "
traditional way of specifying space or TAB: "[ TAB]" where TAB is a 
  litteral tabulation
POSIX way of specifying white space: "[[:blank:]]"
GNU SED way of specifying white space: "\W"

traditional way of specifying more than one match of X: "XX*"
POSIX way of specifying more than one match of X: "X\{1,\}"
GNU sed way of specifying more than one match of X: "X\+"

(By traditional sed, I refer to the sed described in the mac mahonpaper
dating back from july 1978. The POSIX version always also works on GNU 
sed)

> What am I doing wrong?

replace \s+ by either:
  [ TAB][ TAB]*
  [[:blank:]]\{1,\}
  \W\+

On DEC/Compaq Tru64 this seems to do the trick:

 sed -n '/one/,/two/p' filename

Does the job, but if there are more than two words on a line then adding

 | sed 's/^\([^ ]* [^ ]*\) .*/\1/' filename

Does the job.

Basically, the first sed command gets the right lines, then the second
sed does the following (this works if you have more than two words on
each line):
^		anchors to the start of each line
\(...\)	stores the enclosed match into buffer 1
[^ ]*		matches a number of non-space chars (eg a word)
[^ ]* [^ ]*	matches two words
 .*		matches the rest of the line
\1		print the contents of buffer 1

It may not be the most elegant but it does it works !

Bjorn,

Thanks.  I still don't understand.  Given this file

C:\Temp\#\!>type 2.txt
one one
one two
one three
two one
two two
two three
three one
three two
three three

I would expect "sed -n /^one/,/^two/p 2.txt" to display the first 4
lines, but here's what I get:

C:\Temp\#\!>sed -n /^one/,/^two/p 2.txt
one one
one two
one three
two one
three one
three two

Also, I really want to be able to specify the white space and the second
word as well, and am having no luck.  No records are printed by

sed -n /^one\s+o/,/^two\s+o/p 2.txt

although I was hoping for the first 4.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks,
Peter

it most certainly does not what the OP wants, i.e. print
only the first four lines.

I don't know which or whose job it does, but if the idea is to
remove everything past the second word if a line contains more
than two, then yes it works, only if words are not separated
by more than one space (and if the line does not start with a 
space, too).

It doesn't use sed, but it's neat:

echo $textstuff | col -b

Hi All,

I'm trying to determine the best way to find a pattern and print it out.  Example:

# <PATTERN>

The pattern I'm searching for may have no space after the #, it may have several, it may have a tab, etc...  Any thoughts on how to best accomplish this?

Thank you,

Rich

THis is typically a question so vague that it can only receive vague
answers.

first, what do you call 'pattern'? is it a word? a regular expression?
do you wish that there be a # and optional white space before the
pattern? or any lines containing the patterns should be printed?
Do you want to print only the pattern or the line containing it?
...

> Any thoughts on how to best accomplish this?

Here are just examples.
a) print lines containing the string of characters 'Richard'
  sed -n '/Richard/p'
or
  sed '/Richard/!d'
b) print lines starting with #, optional multiple whistespace, then Richard
  sed '/^#[[:blank:]]*Richard/!d'
c) print lines containing the word Richard, but not ABRichard or Richardson:
  sed 's/.*/ & /;/[^a-zA-Z]Richard[^a-zA-Z]/!d;s/^.//;s/.$//'
(i.e. add non-letters to the start and end of lines, ignore lines not
containing Richard surroundered by two non-letters, remove the first
and last chars (that is, the two non-letters we added)

d) print lines containing something looking like an email address
  sed '/[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\{1,\}@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\{1,\}/!d'
e) print lines starting with #, optional space, then an email address
  sed '/#[[:blank:]]*[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\{1,\}@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\{1,\}/!d'
f) print all email addresses found, and only these, one on each line
  sed '
  # remove < and >
  s/[<>]//g
  # surround all addresses by <...>
  s/[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\{1,\}@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\{1,\}/<&>/g
  # if no address found on this line, kill this line
  /</!d
  # replace the line by >line<
  s/.*/>&</
  # replace everything between email addresses by a newline
  s/>[^<]*</\
  /g'

To get a precise answer you should ask a more precise question.

Try this book.   http://cwx.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/patsis/

It has a lot of good excercises, and teaches you grep, regular 
expressions and Awk too, in addition to Sed. 

And this book has good chapters on Sed and Awk:

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Status:   

Sorry about the vagueness of my question, I'll try to restate it better -

I have a file that contains multiples instances of the word DEVICE.  Now, IF there is a line where DEVICE is found directly after #, I want to print it.  The catch is, 

- sometimes there is a space or multiple spaces between # and DEVICE
- sometimes there is a tab between # and DEVICE
- sometimes there is now space and it will look like #DEVICE

Example file

# The DEVICE should be configured by setting...
# DEVICE=/dev/random

The line I want to print out is "# DEVICE=/dev/random"

Sometimes that line will look like

#DEVICE=/dev/random

or

#    DEVICE=/dev/random

Hope that makes better sense.

Thanks,

Rich

THis is typically a question so vague that it can only receive vague
answers.

first, what do you call 'pattern'? is it a word? a regular expression?
do you wish that there be a # and optional white space before the
pattern? or any lines containing the patterns should be printed?
Do you want to print only the pattern or the line containing it?
...

> Any thoughts on how to best accomplish this?

Here are just examples.
a) print lines containing the string of characters 'Richard'
  sed -n '/Richard/p'
or
  sed '/Richard/!d'
b) print lines starting with #, optional multiple whistespace, then Richard
  sed '/^#[[:blank:]]*Richard/!d'
c) print lines containing the word Richard, but not ABRichard or Richardson:
  sed 's/.*/ & /;/[^a-zA-Z]Richard[^a-zA-Z]/!d;s/^.//;s/.$//'
(i.e. add non-letters to the start and end of lines, ignore lines not
containing Richard surroundered by two non-letters, remove the first
and last chars (that is, the two non-letters we added)

d) print lines containing something looking like an email address
  sed '/[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\{1,\}@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\{1,\}/!d'
e) print lines starting with #, optional space, then an email address
  sed '/#[[:blank:]]*[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\{1,\}@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\{1,\}/!d'
f) print all email addresses found, and only these, one on each line
  sed '
  # remove < and >
  s/[<>]//g
  # surround all addresses by <...>
  s/[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\{1,\}@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\{1,\}/<&>/g
  # if no address found on this line, kill this line
  /</!d
  # replace the line by >line<
  s/.*/>&</
  # replace everything between email addresses by a newline
  s/>[^<]*</\
  /g'

To get a precise answer you should ask a more precise question.

I am assuming that the '#' only occurs at the beginning of the line.

sed -n '/^#[    ]*DEVICE/p' <file>

The []:s contains a space and a tab.

Thanks a bunch!

Gonzo,

The character ^ signifies the beginning of each line. 
The character $ signifies the end of each line. 

To insert some text at the end of each line of a file use:

sed -e 's/$/insert some text/' filename.txt > filename.sql

Priya

The $ indicates the end of the line.
PS: Informix database?

Many thanks Priya and Don

That did the trick. I also found that I had to convert the line breaks from DOS to unix with:-

sed 's/^M$//' index.txt > newindex.txt

cheers

You may also have the set option notextmode  while in vi, if you are using
linux - :set notextmode
Alternately, adding the sed script you list below sometimes needs to be done
in conjunction with deleteing the last line of the file (your first email
looked like you were planning some type of load, as you put an sql extension
on the file). If the last line looks like ^Z
Sed /^Z/d infile>outfile

This awk script should work:

   #---GNU awk script---
   BEGIN { FS = "[: ]+" }        # Reset the Field Separator
   
   /^Store:/ { a = $2 }          # Put the store number in 'a'
   
   /\|/ {                        # For each line that has bars ..
                                 # .. put R or S into 'b'
     b = match($0, /^[RS]/) ? substr($0,1,1) : b ;
     sub(/^[RS]/, "")            # .. and delete the R or S
     $0 = a "|" b $0             # .. and change the line
   }
   
   { print }
   #---end of file-----

   It's not sed, but it works. Hope that's not a problem for you.
Could sed have done it? Yes, but I'm at work now and I don't have the
time to figure it out. It might take a half-hour of work to do it in
sed, and I can code the solution more quickly in awk. Sed is great for
a lot of things, but not for everything.

well, the algorithm suitable for a sed implementation would be:
if there is no '|' on the line, 
then 
  remember the store number in the hold buf, 
  and print the line verbatim
else
  if the line starts with a 'S' or a 'R', 
  then 
    remove any letter from the hold buffer 
    (like, if the hold buf contained '005|S' it now contains
      "005|")
    append that field to the hold buf 
    (the hold buf would then hold typically: "005|R") 
    remove that letter from the line (so that all lines
    begin with "|..."
  endif
  prepend the hold buf to the line
endif

I now proceed to write it down in sed syntax, but I don't 
have time to test it so beware...

  /|/!{
    h
    # keep only the number ...
    s/[^0-9]//g
    # ... followed by '|' ...
    s/$/|/
    # ... in the hold buffer
    x
    # print the line with no further changes
    b
  }
  # else
  /^[SR]/{
    # if the S or R changes
    # move to the hold buf
    x
    # remove any previous letter
    s/[SR]//
    # get the line
    G
    # keep only the S or R
    s/\n\(.\).*/\1/
    # back to the line
    x
    # remove that letter
    s/.//
  }
  # general case of lines containing a '|'
  # to prepend the hold buf to the line, start appending it
  G
  # and now move it to the front
  s/\(.*\)\n\(.*\)/\2\1/
  # that's it, line will be printed by default


(again, written in one go, and not checked in any way)

   You're welcome, but I'm no sed whiz. The real experts are
Laurent and Joe, who whipped those sed answers off lickety
split. I just have a few lucky minutes. Plus, I'm lazy, so I
look for the easy answers.

   Laurent and Joe should probably take the gold and silver
on this one. Kudos, champs!

while you're at trying to find the smallest way, here is my version
stripped of comments and slightly compacted:

sed '/|/!{h;s/[^0-9]//g;s/$/|/;x;b;}
/^|/!{x;G;s/|.*\n\(.\).*/|\1/;x;s/.//;}
G;s/\(.*\)\n\(.*\)/\2\1/' < InputFile

recreational seders

have created sed scripts
to play the towers of hanoi
the first towers of hanoi
came from MIT
another recreational seder
added color to hanoi towers.

on his web page
an advanced (PhD wannabe ?) oriental
seder (sed-user)
sports
	the towers of hanoi
	(and an amazing math sed script)
-

can a creative seder create a sed script
to generate/create :

 ---------------------------------------------

		sierpinski triangle

 ---------------------------------------------
                          ?




why sierpinski triangle   ?

probably the easiest
fractal  /  1d "game of life",
rolled in one.

as a game of life
dr dr wolfram of mathematica and " a new kind of science" tome
created it
in his younger years.

probably the prettiest/easiest "game of life" pattern
albeit/because
 1-dimensionalish.


forget hilbert/peano/koch/dragon  curves.
forget 2d "game of life/cellular automata"
hardly seddable/awkable.

There is no way to know what you want to do based on your
description. Could you elaborate a bit, and perhaps provide an example
of what you want to do (ie, input and desired output)?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Using GNU sed, hexadecimal characters are represented by \xHH, where HH are hex characters between 00 and FF, inclusive. The \xHH syntax can be used on either the left or the right side of the substitution. Thus, to show an example:

    echo ABC | sed 's/\x42/- MATCH -/'

will return 'A- MATCH -C'.  The latest version of GNU sed permits the NUL character (0x00) in input files and in the substitution. While GNU sed _can_ handle binary files, in general it's better to use tr (translate) for single-character replacements.

> thanx buzy Paolo !

thanks for the challenge poet seder!  I now have two 12 command scripts for Sierpinski
triangles:

C:\WINNT\Profiles\Utente\Desktop>echo ________X | sed -f sierp.sed
________X________
_______X_X_______
______X___X______
_____X_X_X_X_____
____X_______X____
___X_X_____X_X___
__X___X___X___X__
_X_X_X_X_X_X_X_X_
X_______________X

They stop when the figure has grown large enough, instead of showing only the center of
the triangle.

   sed 's/regex/&_DEL_/; s/_DEL_.*$//' file

This depends on '_DEL_' being nowhere in the source document. It can be replaced with \a or \f or any other string that your version of sed supports, any string which will not occur in the input file.

s/regex/&\

s/\n.*//


The assumption is that there are no newlines in your pattern space
beforehand.

Subject: Deleting a line with a specific pattern
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi,

I've been working with sed for only a few days, and I ran into a wall.

There is a file (user_stats.log) with usernames and some other info.
There is a variable $user which is the username. Once the user is 
given, I am supposed to delete the line that contains that user name.
I've tried:
sed "/$user/d" user_stats.log
which displayed the correct result on the terminal, but made no 
changes in the file

sed "/$user/d" user_stats.log > user_stats.log
which, of course, did not display anything on the terminal and the 
file ended up empty.

I've tried using a capital D as well, with same results.

What am I doing wrong?

Thank you very much in advance.

Sincerely,
Sanjin Bicanic

Sanjin,

Don't redirect it to same file.

Say if you are manipulating the file user_stats.log
then try

sed "/$user/d" user_stats.log > output
Output will be availabe in the file output

Definitely It will work.

Good Luck
Khan

Subject: commenting a file
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi Sed-users/gurus,

I have a small problem in commenting a file, which looks like:


line1
line2
.subckt a b c d
line3
.subckt A B
+ C D
+ E F
line4
.subckt X Y
line5
.subckt Z
+ W







Now, I want to comment out those lines that begin with
.subckt            
      AND
are followed by a line that has + character in the first position.

If a line has a .subckt but the next line is not followed by +, then
no commenting is required.

So, the output would look like:

line1
line2
.subckt a b c d
line3
*.subckt A B
*+ C D
*+ E F
line4
.subckt X Y
line5
*.subckt Z
*+ W


the script:
 sed 's/^\.subckt/*/' infile > log

doesn't work as it comments everything with subckt?

Any clues as to what is going wrong?

Thanks in advance.

You can use the hold space for this.

In essence, 
1. read a line
2. if .subckt put line into hold space
3. read next line.
4. if the line is +, then exchange with hold space
5. Add comment to line in the pattern space.
6. Print the pattern space.
7. Get back hold space and print it
8. Go to start of script.

The details are left as an excersize for the student.

Subject: Adding a newline at the last line.
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I am unable to solve this one...possibly because I have lost touch 
with sed now...

I have a file order.txt, which has an `incomplete line' at the end. I 
was to add a newline character at the end.

$ cat order.txt
1
M0057$

It should be

$ cat order.txt
1
M0057
$

I tried doing it this way:
$ sed '$s/\([a-zA-Z0-9\.][a-zA-Z0-9\.]*\)$/\1^J/' order.txt
1

The last line is deleted. I don't have a solid understanding of these 
newlines, and this problem puzzles me. Kindly help me solve this. 
Thanks in advance.

Amarendra

Subject: Re: Adding a newline at the last line.
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

This example confuses me because you have a $ at the end of the last line.

What is that $ supposed to represent?

In sed, the $ represents the end of the line, not the end of a file.

Here is a script that does it:

/^\.subckt/{            # If the line starts with .subckt
	N               # add next line
                        # Check if it's a + line, if so make substitution

I have trouble testing this script because my sed (I don't know how to
determine my sed version) and my Unix Korn shell won't accept its syntax,
mainly with newline in RHS of RE s/\n+ /... (error: Command garbled) and any
label (error: Label too long).

However, I suspect this script would fail if the qualified comment .subckt
and + section is immediately preceded by a .subckt line. For example, remove
"line3" in the sample input file. I believe the script would miss the
qualified comment section immediately below "line3". What do you think?

Which platform are you using? As a first measure, I suspect that you
copy-pasted the script. The error about the label sounds like you have
a lot of space characters after the 'a'. Go through the script and
make sure that there is no trailing blanks on any line, and at least
that error should go away. I think that the other error could be
related to this also, ie that you have extra blanks after the line
with the substitution command.

You are quite right. Change the script to the following, and it should
work better. I changed the b command on line 6 to a P and a D command.

/^\.subckt/{
	N
	s/\n+ /\
*+ /
	ta
	P               # Print the first line in pattern space
	D               # delete 1st line and start over from the top
:a
	s/^/\*/
	n
	/^\+ /ba
}

You are right. Both "s/\n+ /\" and "ta" lines have to have nothing trailing,
not even "#" comment.

Using your script, I got this surprised output:
line1
line2
.subckt a b c d
line3
*.subckt A B
*+ C D
*+ E F
line4
*.subckt X Y
line5

I'm afraid I cant help you, since my script gives the correct output
both using Solaris 9 sed and GNU sed, the latter both on Solaris and
Linux. The output I get is

line1
line2
.subckt a b c d
line3
*.subckt A B
*+ C D
*+ E F
line4
.subckt X Y
line5
*.subckt Z
*+ W

which is correct AFAICT. I am now even more curious which platform you
are using. :-) Do you have the possibility of trying it on another
platform or with another sed?

Hi Bjorn,
Thank you v. much and to other sed gurus who took their
precious time to help my problem.

I used your script (which is commented so well for a sed script)
and it runs flawlessly.
Regds.,

I don't have other sed or other platform to try.

Using Eric Pement's FAQ suggestion on how to find out the sed version, this
is all I got:

/bin> strings sed | grep -i ver
_lib_version
_on_everest
@(#)SCO OpenServer 5.1.0/Unix 5.0.5Eb 98/07/27

I guess I am using a buggy version of sed!

But, as you haven't answered that question yet, we can't explain why the
script behaves weirdly on *your* sed

> You are right. Both "s/\n+ /\" and "ta" lines have to have nothing
trailing,

Note that the so-called "#" comment is a command on its own, so it should be
prefixed by a semicolon if following another command. Also note that using
"\*" in the RHS, of "\+" in the LHS are not portable. It should be "*" and
"+"
respectively. (if you're concerned that some old, broken sed might
misunderstand "\{1,\}" when encouentering "+" in the LHS, then unse "[+]".)
Last, it should be "/^\.\.subckt/", not  "/^\.subckt/".
The corrected script whould thus be:

/^\.\.subckt/{
N
s/\n+ /\
*+ /
ta
P;              # Print the first line in pattern space
D;              # delete 1st line and start over from the top
:a
s/^/*/
n
/^+ /ba
}


> Using your script, I got surprising output...
> Notice the extra "*" added on line after "line4".

perhaps your sed has buggy t implementation. It works on GNU sed 3.0.2 up to
4.0.6.

Hi,
This should work.

sed '/ab/{G;G;G;G;G;}' file1 > file2

If you want more or fewer new lines, alter then number of G's accordingly.

If the PATTERN and N are known when writing the script, then this works:

---8<--- sed script
/ab/a\
\
\
\
\

---8<---

If they are not known when writing the script, then it becomes harder.
The following script will re-create the proper sed script from the
input: for 1 <= N <= 9

---8<--- input
PATTERN=ab
N=5
---8<---

---8<--- sed script
/^PATTERN=/{
  s///
  # quote sed LHS metacharacters
  s/[][/\\*^$]/\\&/g
  s/.*/\/&\/a\//
}
/^N=/{
  s///
  # transform a digit into n-1 dots
  s/./&12.3..4...5....6.....7......8.......9......../
  s/\(.\).*\1\(\.*\).*/\2/
  # replace each dot by backslash, newline.
  s/\./\\\
/gp
}
---8<---

You are right. I removed the "ta" using the following:

/^\.subckt/{
        N
        /\n+ /!{P;D;}
        s/\n+ /\
*+ /
        :a
        s/^/*/
        n
        /^+ /ba
        }

And I got the correct output.

However, the script is still flawed. It would miss the second block in such
input:

.subckt A B
+ C D
+ E F
.subckt A B
+ C D
+ E F

To fix this, I added another branch s:

/^\.subckt/{
        :s
        N
        /\n+ /!{P;D;}
        s/\n+ /\
*+ /
        :a
        s/^/*/
        n
        /^+ /ba
        /^\.subckt/bs
        }

Subject: Deleting part of pattern space
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Hi Sed-users/Gurus,

How do we delete the first portion of a pattern space (upto 1st \n)
which has multiple newlines in it and not return control
to the top of the script? (i'm using the standard sed supplied
with unix ----> /bin/sed )

Say my pattern space is:
         
PartA\nPartB\nPartC\nPartD

        
I want the pattern space to look like this:

PartB\nPartC\nPartD



note, \n ==> newline character in the pattern space


D will do what I want, but will also take me to the top of the script
which I don't want(beacuse I want to do something w/ the remaining
pattern space)


s/^.*\n// will eat up all the leading newlines and give me
   only PartD.

Is there any command that can accomplish this?

Thanks in advance,
budding-sedder.

   s/^[^\n]*\n//

One of the items on my sed "wish list" many years ago was a
command like D which would return control to the top of the
current brace level. But this is really syntactic sugar, and
I have learned to avoid a high-sugar diet. Especially here!!

Subject: SED recognizing EOF
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

Greetings,

I need to add a field at the starting of each line in
a file. I used SED to do so. But since sed is a line
editor, it always does not add this field to the last
line.

Syntax i used is 

sed s/^/"Data"/input file > output file

Any work around for this. pls. do help me with the
syntax.

Thanks,
-Jay

Right. I only added the comments directly in the mail for increased
clarity. I don't have the comments in my own test script, so I didn't
want to clutter up the script by using semicolons or putting comments
on separate lines. Maybe I should have noted that.

This is incorrect. The matched text is literally '.subckt', so there
should only be one escaped period.

note that there is some ambiguty in the POSIX spec: one *could*
interpret [^\n] as matching anything but a backslash or an 'n'...
the paranoid way would then be:

  y/\n_/_\n/;s/^[^_]*_//;y/\n_/_\n/

Subject: cut problem with "1,2,3,4" is a single field in a csv
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

I have a comma separated file and within the lines a value can exist that also contains commas.

For example

0,1,2,3,"1,2,3,4",5,"6,7,8",7,8

field #0 = 1
field #1 = 1
field #2 = 2
field #3 = 3
field #4 = 1,2,3,4
field #5 = 5
field #6 = 6,7,8
field #7 = 7
field #8 = 8

I am trying to pick out the 7th field using the unix cut command but it returns 3 for our above example:

$ echo 0,1,2,3,"1,2,3,4",5,"6,7,8",7,8 | cut -d',' -f7
3

Can you please suggest a method (possibly using sed to replace everything within the quotes) to get the 7th field?  NOTE: the 7th field will never contain a "x,y,z" string.

Regards

Simon

I would use the following:

  # Change all quoted fields to '_'
  s/"[^"]*"/_/g
  # Extract the 7th field
  s/[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,\([^,]*\).*/\1/

I takes advantage of the fact that the 7th field is never quoted. If
the field is quoted, you can use the following script (comments added
in this post only):

:a
        # Remove 1st field if it is quoted
	s/^"[^"]*",//
	tb
        # Remove 1st field if not quoted
	s/^[^,]*,//
:b
        # Keep count of how many fields we have removed by adding
        # 'a':s to the hold space
	x
	s/.*/&a/
        # If the nth field is wanted, there should be n - 1 a:s here
        # Current setting will extract 7th field
	/aaaaaa/bc
	x
        # The reason t is used instead of b here is to reset the test flag
        # The substiution cannot fail, so this jump will always be made
	ta
:c
        # Reset counter (hold space) for next input line
        s/.*//
	x
        # 2 following lines removes the trailing fields after the one
        # we want
	/^"/s/^\("[^"]*"\).*/\1/
	/^[^"]/s/,.*//

this is beginning to become a very frequent topic (and IIRC this particular

Let's see... your files are either of the form
  [^,"]*,   anything but commas and quotes, followed by a comma
  "[^"]*",  anything but quotes, surrounded by quotes, followed by a comma

in ERE (extended regular expressions), one could use the following to match
ONE field followed by a comma:
  ("[^"]*"|[^,"]*),
some SED implementations allow ERE in BRE notations, as an extension.
In GNU sed, for instance, ONE field would be:
  \("[^"]*"\|[^,"]*\),
so, to surround the 8th field with underscores in GNU sed you could do:
  s/\("[^"]*"\|[^,"]*\),/_\1_/8
and to then print it, a simple
  s/[^_]*_//;s/_.*//
suffices. Hence the GNU sed solution is:

  echo '0,1,2,3,"1,2,3,4",5,"6,7,8",7,8' | sed \
  's/\("[^"]*"\|[^,"]*\),/_\1_/8;s/[^_]*_//;s/_.*//'

(assuming you do not have any underscores in your sample)

In plain POSIX sed, where the alternation \| does not exist, you can observe
that
  \("[^"*"\)*[,"]*,
will match one field in any case (it would also match
  "a""b""c"d,
as one field, but I'm assuming you can't have this in your sample).
It would then be thus in POSIX sed:

  echo '0,1,2,3,"1,2,3,4",5,"6,7,8",7,8' | sed \
  's/\(\("[^"]*"\)*[^,"]*\),/_\1_/8;s/[^_]*_//;s/_.*//'

Finally some very old sed implementation do not support repeated grouping
like \(...\)*. For these seds, you could simply replace any "a,b,c" field by
the empty field, like this:

  echo '0,1,2,3,"1,2,3,4",5,"6,7,8",7,8' | sed \
  's/"[^"]*"//g;s/,/_/7;s/[^_]*_//;s/,.*//'

but this only works if the 7th field is not of the form "a,b,c" .

One easy thing to do is to resave the file as a tab delimited file, then
change the tabs to pipes, then run a quick awk script:
            1       1       2       3       1,2,3,4 5       6,7,8   7

in vi - :%s/        /|/g

then run:

In response to Jay:

  Probably caused by the fact that the last line of input does not end
in a newline. This seems to be a bug in your version of sed. The
current versions of GNU sed will handle the last line correctly, even
if it does not have a trailing newline.

> Syntax i used is

   This ought to produce an error, unless "input" represents a valid
switch or combination of switches to the s/// command. A better syntax
would look like this, and depending on your shell and what you
actually insert as data, you may want to use 'single quotes' instead
of "double quotes":

  sed "s/^/Data/" input_file > output_file

HTH.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Status:   

You might use the cut command to isolate each column of data based on the
quotes, like so:
cat file | cut -d\" -f1 > junkf1 and so on for four or five columns.
Then, you could change the commas between the quotes to something easier to
handle like _, one file at a time.
Then,  you could merge the columns back again with:
paste -d" " junkf1 junkf2 and so on.
You would have to remove the extra space if that were a problem.

Not sure exactly what you want, but this should be a good start. It essentially comes from Chapter 4 of _The Unix Programming Environment_ by Kernighan and Pike, 1984.

< inputfile tr -sc [:alpha:] '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

Explanation:
tr -sc converts all non-alphabetic characters to newlines, and compresses adjacent newlines to one. Thus giving a list of words, one per line.
sort puts identical words together
uniq -c gives a count of identical words, with an example of each
sort -nr numerically sorts the count, in reverse order
head -10 selects the 10 words of greatest frequency.

Example, running this script on a manual page text output, I get:
man man | col -b | tr -sc [:alpha:] '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

80 man
