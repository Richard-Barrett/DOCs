   Hello, Donald Siegfriedt!  Above is the Chinese name which 
was "inspired" by your English name.  Chinese uses characters rather
than an alphabet, so names cannot be directly translated from English
to Chinese.  However, Chinese characters can be chosen which approximate
the English pronounciation, which is what this program does.
<P>
   Chinese names generally have 3 characters.  The surname, which is
usually 1 character, comes first.  Next are one or two characters which
are chosen by the parents (or the grandparents in traditional Chinese
culture).  This program chooses the surname and given names according
to the spelling of your name and the characteristics you choose.  The
selection is not unique though.  Everytime you use this tool, you will
likely get a different name.  So if you don't like the first name
you get, try again.
<P>
   This page is mostly created for entertainment.  Real Chinese names
should be chosen by someone who knows the nuances of Chinese language
and culture.  Ask a native speaker if you want a Chinese name you will
actually use.  Also, this tool will not translate Chinese names written
in English back to their original Chinese form.
<P>
