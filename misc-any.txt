JULES (from Pulp Fiction)
There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: 
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides 
by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through 
the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the 
finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great 
vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my 
brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance 
upon you."

(01:44:09 PM) Heidi Jarman: words to live by:
“So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their view, 
and demand that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and 
its purpose in the service of your people. Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide.

Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place. Show respect to all 
people and grovel to none.

When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault 
lies only in yourself. Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision.

When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep 
and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.”

~ Chief Tecumseh

Bud Haggart video script[edit]
For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to bring perfection to the crudely conceived idea of a transmission that would 
not only supply inverse reactive current for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing 
cardinal grammeters. Such an instrument is the turbo-encabulator.

Now basically the only new principle involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative motion of conductors and fluxes, it's 
produced by the modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance.

The original machine had a base plate of pre-famulated amulite surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two 
spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to 
the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented.

The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots of the stator, every seventh conductor being 
connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdle spring on the "up" end of the grammeters.

The turbo-encabulator has now reached a high level of development, and it’s being successfully used in the operation of novertrunnions. Moreover, 
whenever a forescent skor motion is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation dingle arm, to reduce 
sinusoidal repleneration.

It's not cheap, but I'm sure the government will buy it. [unfurls $750,000,000 price tag]

(We are discussing the usage of the Oxford Comma, where a comma is placed before the “and” when listing words.)

Teacher: “Okay, so for those of you not sure of whether or not to use the comma, here’s an example of where it would matter.”

(He writes: “We invited the strippers, Hitler, and Stalin.” on the board.)

Teacher: “Now, if we were to put the Oxford Comma in, like so, we will be having a great time with two of history’s worst men. But if we

Just Telling It Like It Is
LIQUOR STORE | FL, USA | AT THE CHECKOUT, AWESOME CUSTOMERS, AWESOME WORKERS, BIZARRE
(Two customers approach the counter, the first being a tall, bald man and 
the second being an elderly lady.)

Customer: “Hi. I’m every customer ever, and I have a bunch of stupid 
questions and unreasonable demands.”

Me: “Hi. I’m every employee ever, and I present a negative attitude as 
well as an unforgivable ignorance of both the products my employer sells 
and how to conduct myself civilly with other human beings.”

Customer: “Like an idiot, I have approached you with no idea what I want. 
But I nevertheless expect you to keep your full attention on me while I 
waste your time.”

Me: “That’s fine. I’ve already tuned you out and began to sing the theme 
song to Duck Tales to myself in my head as you bring us collectively closer 
to death without having accomplished anything meaningful.”

Customer: “Regarding [liquor], I will now proceed to barrage you with 
questions about it that either you have no way of knowing, or which I 
should already d*** well know the answers to.”

(I hand him a bottle of the liquor he mentioned and start to ring it up.)

Me: “I respond to your worthless questions with vague and unsatisfying 
responses, as my cranial faculties are occupied with lewd and lascivious 
irrelevancies. That will be [price], you personification of the downfall 
of western civilization.”

Customer: “I object to the price quoted, even though it is clearly indicated 
on the shelf behind you, and suggest some sort of extortion on your part, undoubtedly 
fueled by prejudice towards some aspect of my appearance, race, culture, or creed.”

Me: “Although mentally I am most certainly questioning your intelligence, 
parentage and/or upbringing, I merely offer transparently insincere apologies.”

Customer: “I proclaim in brash and vulgar terms my dissatisfaction. I make a 
laughable and grandiose claim of my own importance, such as being a millionaire, 
the brother of your company’s CEO, or perhaps the good old-fashioned 
‘Do you have any idea who I am?’ I further suggest that I could have you fired 
effortlessly and fully intend to do so for the insufficient quantity of butt-kissing 
you have exhibited toward me over the course of this transaction.”

Me: “I sadly inform you that my superior is not present on the premises and 
unhelpfully refer you to the company help line. Quietly I memorize the details of 
your face so that I can fantasize about committing acts of unspeakable and 
grotesque violence toward same at some later date.”

(The customer begins walking out the door.)

Customer: “Vague and impotent threat to your person and questioning of your sexual orientation!”

Me: “Sarcastic suggestion to have a nice day!”

(He walks out the door. The old lady behind him looks thoroughly perplexed by our exchange.)

Old Lady: “Who was that?”

Me: *shrugging* “My manager.”

Friday Funny:

Note: choose whichever nationality you feel is appropriate.

A large group of Iraqi soldiers are moving down a road when they hear a voice call from behind a 
sand-dune. "One Marine is better than ten Iraqi's." The Iraqi commander quickly sends 10 of his best 
soldiers over the dune whereupon a gun-battle breaks out and continues for a few minutes, then silence.

The voice then calls out "One Marine is better than one hundred Iraqi's." Furious, the Iraqi commander 
sends his next best 100 troops over the dune and instantly a huge gunfight commences. After 10 minutes 
of battle, again silence.

The voice calls out again "One Marine is better than one thousand Iraqi's." The enraged Iraqi Commander 
musters one thousand fighters and sends them across the dune. Cannon, rocket and machine gun fire ring 
out as a huge battle is fought. Then silence.

Eventually one wounded Iraqi fighter crawls back over the dune and with his dying words tells his 
commander, "Don't send any more men, it's a trap. There's actually two of them."

America is facing a crisis. I'm not talking about health care, unemployment or even the 
packs of kangaroos swarming the Midwest and raping everyone in sight. I'm talking about 
our catchphrase shortage. This nation was built on the strength of our catchphrases. 
Without "Give me liberty or give me death!" and "The British are coming!" we might as 
well be Canada or the Bermuda Triangle. That is why it is so important we maintain this 
heritage of catchphrases.

I was hopeful when Borat had every douche on the planet saying "Very nice!", but it's 
been three years and that well is dry. So I'm offering new catchphrases. I don't expect 
to return us to our heyday when "Dy-no-mite"s and "Where's the beef?"s were falling from 
trees like golden apples, but hopefully with this list and a little effort on your part 
we can get the ball rolling in the right direction.

(Don't worry, I'm not going to half-ass it and just slap together a bunch of random 
words and nonsensical phrases. I'm going to 51%-ass it and include when and how to use 
these phrases.)

That's bullshit, Marty! - To be shouted in church every time the pastor pauses.

And rub your junk on it. - State plainly after you've given a waitress your order.

Only one of us is getting out of here without poop in their hair. - Whisper on crowded 
elevator.

This one's for Jesus! - To be shouted at the exact moment of orgasm.

Skittles and foreskin - Like "Whatever," this is used to show indifference. Like if your 
wife says she's leaving you after 10 years of marriage... "Skittles and foreskin, man. 
Skittles and foreskin."

Jangleplatz! - Replacement for "Awesome." Simply because I'm tired of every asshole with 
the mind of a 14-year-old using some form of "awesome" to describe anything because 
they're unaware of other adjectives. If people use this, that shit would be jangleplatz. 
(That sounds awesome.)

Murf da skwaaay! - Not sure, something rappers should say.

Take it all, Becky! - To be angrily yelled while using a public urinal.

I was promised ass-play! - To be shouted at any cashier or sales clerk who asks for payment.

To the reservoir! - Shout at any motorist with his or her window rolled down.

She like-a da turkey bacon. - For women only. To be whispered during gynecological exams.

There's mommy's little buck-buck. - Kneel down and say this when you see a midget.

The dialogue from an episode of Three's Company! - Shout at concerts in place of "Freebird!"

Let's teabag that fucker! - Shout halfway through the eulogy.

Kegels 'til you bleed! - Shout as loud as you can at any person on a cell phone.

Queef on that nigga! - Response when someone disrespects you. And despite the use 
of "nigga," is to be used on assholes of any race. If someone bumps into you in a bar, 
whether they're black, white or one of those other gross races, give them a hearty 
"Queef on that nigga!"

Because for a system administrator, paranoia is a basic job requirement. Consequently, 
when it comes to data security, there's no such thing as too much overkill. Even when 
you have subjected the drive to a thermite reaction, let it cool, and ground the whole 
resulting mess down to the consistency of talcum powder, you still have to scatter the 
ashes over at least a thousand square miles of ocean, just to be sure. Ideally, you'd 
scatter half the ashes over the central Pacific, some of them over the north Atlantic, 
and the rest over the southern ocean.

Extra bonus points if you scrub the platters with fluorine trichloride before putting 
it through the thermite reaction.

Even then, you'll never be fully comfortable with the job until you destroy the entire 
galaxy that the drive was in. Maybe the whole universe. You can't be too sure.

I remember seeing an interview with some relatively rich English guy where his plan was to 
not leave any inheritance to his kids. Instead he would match pound for pound the their 
yearly pay. He also made concession for certain jobs that were "humanitarian" related. 
Whether it was being a nurse or working for a charity or something. For those types of 
jobs he would match more than pound for pound. This seemed like a great idea. He 
rewarded hard work with money while also rewarding his children who chose to help others. 
If I were to ever become really rich, I'd like to model this concept.

I like to think he tore his scrotum.
He didn’t do a split and land on his keys the night before a co workers big wedding though.

ven a Nobel Prize does not necessarily protect you. In fact, although he hasn't joined in the Twitterfest, the Vice Chancellor of the Australian National University has previously told the story where the Nobel Prize was the problem.

After winning the 2011 prize in physics, Professor Brian Schmidt tried to take it to America to show his grandparents. Schmidt told Scientific American the gold in the prize medallion absorbs all X-rays, and airport security at Fargo, North Dakota had “never seen anything like it.”

“They said, ‘What’s in the box?’

I said, ‘a large gold medal,’ as one does.

So they opened it up and they said, ‘What’s it made out of?’

I said, ‘gold.’

And they’re like, ‘Uhhhh. Who gave this to you?’

‘The King of Sweden.’

‘Why did he give this to you?’

‘Because I helped discover the expansion rate of the universe was accelerating.’

At which point, they were beginning to lose their sense of humor. I explained to them it was a Nobel Prize, and their main question was, ‘Why were you in Fargo?’"
