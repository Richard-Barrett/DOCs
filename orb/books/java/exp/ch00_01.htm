If you've been at all active on the Internet in the past year, you've heard a lot about Java. It's one of the most exciting developments in the history of the Internet, rivaling the creation of the World Wide Web. Java became the darling of the Internet programming community as soon as the alpha version was released. Immediately, thousands of people were writing Java applets to add to their Web pages. Interest in Java only grew with time, and support for Java in Netscape Navigator guaranteed it would be a permanent part of the Net scene. <P CLASS=para>What, then, is Java? Java is a language for network programmingthat was developed by Sun Microsystems. It's already in widespreaduse for creating animated Web pages. However, this is only thestart. The Java language and environment are rich enough to supportentirely new kinds of applications, like dynamically extensiblebrowsers. There has been talk about new kinds of computer platforms(Java terminals or Java pads) that download all their software overthe network. In the coming years, we'll see what Java is capable ofdoing; fancy Web pages are fun and interesting, but they certainlyaren't the end of the story. If Java is successful (and thatisn't a foregone conclusion), it could change the way we thinkabout computing in fundamental ways.<P CLASS=para>This book sets out to give you a head start on a lot of Javafundamentals. <i CLASS=citetitle>Exploring Java</i> attempts to live upto its name by mapping out the Java language, its class libraries,programming techniques, and idioms. We'll dig deep intointeresting areas, and at least scratch the surface of the rest. Othertitles in the O'Reilly &amp; Associates Java series will pick up wherewe leave off and provide more comprehensive information on specificareas and applications of Java.<P CLASS=para>Whenever possible, we'll provide meaningful, realisticexamples and avoid simply cataloging features. The examples aresimple but hint at what can be done. We won't be developing thenext great "killer Internet app" in these pages, but wehope to give you a starting point for many hours ofexperimentation and tinkering that will lead you to learn more on yourown.<DIV CLASS=sect1><h2 CLASS=sect1><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch00-SECT1-AUTOID.1">The Past Year</A></h2><P CLASS=para>A lot has happened in the year since the first edition of this book.We're now up to release 1.1.1 of Java, which has many more featuresthan the 1.0 release. Java 1.1 adds many, many new features, inaddition to many extensions to the features of Java 1.0.It's clear that Java is changing theway we think about computing in fundamental ways; we don't regret thatprophecy at all. It's becoming more and more clear as time goes onthat Java is central to the way software will be written in thefuture. <P CLASS=para>This edition of <i CLASS=citetitle>Exploring Java</i> tries to give you the flavorof Java 1.1. With a few exceptions, we have uncompromisingly rootedout all deprecated features from Java 1.0. For example, the chapterscovering AWT all use the new event model; we don't even mention the1.0 event model.  The new event model is far and away superior to theold one; there's no need for nostalgia.  The one section in which weallowed ourselves to use deprecated features was the chapter coveringNetworking. In the best of all possible worlds, you would write yourclients and servers to work with Unicode character streams, usingJava's Reader and Writer classes. But this isn't the best of allpossible worlds, and most software still uses byte-oriented ASCII.There's no sense in touting a language designed for portability ifprograms written in that language would have difficulty talking toolder clients and servers around the net.  So wecut ourselves some slack where network I/O streams are concerned. <P CLASS=para>We wish we could say that this was "the second edition" of our book.But that would be a lie. Actually, this is edition 1.9 (well, morelike 1.78). We have updated everything in the first edition to reflectthe best current practice, and we have added discussions of the mostimportant new features.However, the deadline for the CD-ROM didn't let us finish a fewthings that we'd really like to add. In particular, the "real" secondedition will have material on:<P><UL CLASS=itemizedlist><li CLASS=listitem>JavaBeans (Java's component architecture); <P><li CLASS=listitem>Signing classes, and configuring browsers to grant greatercapabilities to signed applets;<P><li CLASS=listitem>RMI (Java's Remote Method Invocation facility).<P></UL><P CLASS=para>We may add some more topics if we get to them. However, we also wantto keep this book reasonably compact. It's our feeling that thousandpage tutorials aren't much help. Furthermore, Java's growing sofast that we have to place limits somewhere: by the end of the year,there should be 2D, 3D, sound, commerce, and many other featuresavailable. </DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>&nbsp;</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><img src='gifs/txthome.gif' border=0 alt='Home'></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch00_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>&nbsp;</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm"><img src='gifs/index.gif' alt='Book Index' border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Audience</td></tr></table><hr align=left width=515><IMG SRC="gifs/smnavbar.gif" USEMAP="#map" BORDER=0> <MAP NAME="map"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="0,0,108,15" HREF="../javanut/index.htm"alt="Java in a Nutshell"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="109,0,200,15" HREF="../langref/index.htm" alt="Java Language Reference"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="203,0,290,15" HREF="../awt/index.htm" alt="Java AWT"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="291,0,419,15" HREF="../fclass/index.htm" alt="Java Fundamental Classes"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="421,0,514,15" HREF="../exp/index.htm" alt="Exploring Java"> </MAP></DIV></BODY></HTML>
