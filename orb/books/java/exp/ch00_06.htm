Thanks totheir efforts, we gave birth to something we can all be proud of.<P CLASS=para>Foremost we would like to thank Tim O'Reilly for givingus the opportunity to write this book. Special thanks to MikeLoukides, the series editor, whose endless patience andexperience got us through the difficult parts and to Paula Ferguson,whose organizational and editing abilities got the material intoits final form. It's due largely to Mike and Paula's tirelessefforts that this book has gotten to you as quickly as it has. Wecould not have asked for a more skillful or responsive team of peoplewith whom to work.<P CLASS=para>Particular thanks are due to our technical reviewers: AndrewCohen, Eric Raymond, and Lisa Farley. All of them gave thoroughreviews that were invaluable in assembling the final draft. Ericcontributed many bits of text that eventually found their way into thebook.<P CLASS=para>Speaking of borrowings, the original version of the glossarycame from David Flanagan's book, <i CLASS=citetitle>Java in aNutshell</i>. We also borrowed the class hierarchy diagramsfrom David's book. These diagrams were based on similar diagramsby Charles L. Perkins. His original diagrams are available at<A HREF="http://rendezvous.com/java/">http://rendezvous.com/java/</A>.<P CLASS=para>Thanks also to Marc Wallace and Steven Burkett for reading thebook in progress. As for the crowd in St. Louis: a special thanks toLeeAnn Langdon of the Library Ltd. and Kerri Bonasch. Deepestthanks to Victoria Doerr for her patience and love. Finally, thanksfor the support of the "lunch" crowd: Karl "Gooch"Stefvater, Bryan "Butter" O'Connor, Brian "Brian"Gottlieb, and the rest of the clan at Washington University.<P CLASS=para>Many people in O'Reilly's production and designgroups contributed their blood, sweat, and tears to the project. MaryAnne Weeks Mayo was production editor and copy editor, and had thestress-filled job of working under a very tight deadline with chaptersarriving asynchronously (which means at random and later thanexpected). Seth Maislin wrote the index, and Stephen Spainhour adaptedDavid Flanagan's glossary for this book. Chris Reilley convertedrough diagrams into professional technical illustrations. Erik Ray,Ellen Siever, and Lenny Muellner converted HTMLfiles into SGML and made sure we could convertelectrons into paper without mishap. Lenny also implemented a newdesign for this book, which was created by Nancy Priest. Hanna Dyercreated the back cover; Edie Freedman designed the front cover.</DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch00_05.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><img src='gifs/txthome.gif' border=0 alt='Home'></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Conventions Used in This Book</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm"><img src='gifs/index.gif' alt='Book Index' border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Yet Another Language?</td></tr></table><hr align=left width=515><IMG SRC="gifs/smnavbar.gif" USEMAP="#map" BORDER=0> <MAP NAME="map"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="0,0,108,15" HREF="../javanut/index.htm"alt="Java in a Nutshell"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="109,0,200,15" HREF="../langref/index.htm" alt="Java Language Reference"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="203,0,290,15" HREF="../awt/index.htm" alt="Java AWT"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="291,0,419,15" HREF="../fclass/index.htm" alt="Java Fundamental Classes"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="421,0,514,15" HREF="../exp/index.htm" alt="Exploring Java"> </MAP></DIV></BODY></HTML>
