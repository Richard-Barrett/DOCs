Here's a road map that tries to impose some order on Java'spast, present, and future. <DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.3">The Past: Java 1.0</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Java 1.0 provided the basic framework for Java development: thelanguage itself, plus packages that let you write applets and simpleapplications. Java 1.0 is officially obsolete, though it will be sometime before vendors catch up with the new release. </DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.4">The Present: Java 1.1</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Java 1.1 is the current version of Java. It incorporates majorimprovements in the AWT package (Java's windowing facility). It alsoadds many completely new features, including: <P><DL CLASS=variablelist><DT CLASS=varlistentry>JDBC<br><DD><P CLASS=para>A general facility for interacting with databases.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry>RMI<br><DD><P CLASS=para>Remote Method Invocation: a facility that lets you call methodsthat are provided by a server running somewhere else on the network.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry>JavaBeans<br><DD><P CLASS=para>Java's component architecture, which we discussed earlier.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry>Security<br><DD><P CLASS=para>A facility for cryptography; this is the basis for signed classes,which we discussed earlier.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry>Internationalization<br><DD><P CLASS=para>The ability to write programs that adapt themselves to thelanguage the user wants to use; the program automatically displaystext in the appropriate language.</DL><P CLASS=para>Java 1.1 incorporates many other improvements and new features, butthese are the most important. As of May, 1997, most Web browsershaven't yet incorporated Java 1.1, but they will as soon as possible.In this book, we'll try to give you a taste of as many features aspossible; unfortunately for us, the Java environment has become sorich that it's impossible to cover everything in a single book.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.5">The Future</A></h3><P CLASS=para>We've mentioned a few of the things that are in the pipeline,including high quality audio, advanced 3D rendering, and speechsynthesis. Other things to look forward to are class libraries foradvanced 2D graphics (Java 2D), electronic commerce (JECF),managing network devices (Java Management),naming and directory services (JNDI),telephony (JTAPI), and writing network servers (Java Server). Betaversions of some of these facilities are available now. <P CLASS=para>We're also starting to see new kinds of computing devices thatincorporate Java. Network computers that are based on Java and use theHotJava browser as their user interface are already available, as are"smart cards": credit card-like devices with a Java processor builtin. You can expect to see Java incorporated into PDAs, telephones, andmany other devices. </DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch01_08.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><img src='gifs/txthome.gif' border=0 alt='Home'></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_10.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Java as a General Application Language</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm"><img src='gifs/index.gif' alt='Book Index' border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Availability</td></tr></table><hr align=left width=515><IMG SRC="gifs/smnavbar.gif" USEMAP="#map" BORDER=0> <MAP NAME="map"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="0,0,108,15" HREF="../javanut/index.htm"alt="Java in a Nutshell"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="109,0,200,15" HREF="../langref/index.htm" alt="Java Language Reference"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="203,0,290,15" HREF="../awt/index.htm" alt="Java AWT"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="291,0,419,15" HREF="../fclass/index.htm" alt="Java Fundamental Classes"> <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="421,0,514,15" HREF="../exp/index.htm" alt="Exploring Java"> </MAP></DIV></BODY></HTML>
