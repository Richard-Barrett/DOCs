If this Registration Agreement is accepted by <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN>,and a domain name is registered in <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN>'s domain name database andassigned to the Registrant, Registrant (&quot;Registrant&quot;) agrees to bebound by the terms of this Registration Agreement and the terms of<SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN>'s Domain Name Dispute Policy (&quot;Dispute Policy&quot;) which isincorporated herein by reference and made a part of this RegistrationAgreement. This Registration Agreement shall be accepted at theoffices of <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN>.B. Fees and Payments.1) Registration or renewal (re-registration) date through March 31, 1998:Registrant agrees to pay a registration fee of One Hundred United StatesDollars (<SPANCLASS="acronym">US</SPAN>$100) as consideration for the registration of each new domainname or Fifty United States Dollars (<SPANCLASS="acronym">US</SPAN>$50) to renew (re-register) anexisting registration.2) Registration or renewal date on and after April 1, 1998:  Registrantagrees to pay a registration fee of Seventy United States Dollars (<SPANCLASS="acronym">US</SPAN>$70)as consideration for the registration of each new domain name or theapplicable renewal (re-registration) fee (currently Thirty-Five UnitedStates Dollars (<SPANCLASS="acronym">US</SPAN>$35)) at the time of renewal (re-registration).3) Period of Service:  The non-refundable fee covers a period of two (2)years for each new registration, and one (1) year for each renewal,and includes any permitted modification(s) to the domain name recordduring the covered period.4) Payment:  Payment is due to Network Solutions within thirty (30)days from the date of the invoice.C.      Dispute Policy. Registrant agrees, as a condition tosubmitting this Registration Agreement, and if the RegistrationAgreement is accepted by <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN>, that the Registrant shall be bound by<SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN>'s current Dispute Policy. The current version of the DisputePolicy may be found at the Inter<SPANCLASS="acronym">NIC</SPAN> Registration Services web site:&quot;<ACLASS="systemitem.url"HREF="http://www.netsol.com/rs/dispute-policy.html">http://www.netsol.com/rs/dispute-policy.html</A>&quot;.D.      Dispute Policy Changes or Modifications. Registrant agreesthat <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN>, in its sole discretion, may change or modify the DisputePolicy, incorporated by reference herein, at any time. Registrantagrees that Registrant's maintaining the registration of a domain nameafter changes or modifications to the Dispute Policy become effectiveconstitutes Registrant's continued acceptance of these changes ormodifications. Registrant agrees that if Registrant considers any suchchanges or modifications to be unacceptable, Registrant may requestthat the domain name be deleted from the domain name database.E.      Disputes. Registrant agrees that, if the registration of itsdomain name is challenged by any third party, the Registrant will besubject to the provisions specified in the Dispute Policy.F.      Agents. Registrant agrees that if this Registration Agreementis completed by an agent for the Registrant, such as an <SPANCLASS="acronym">ISP</SPAN> orAdministrative Contact/Agent, the Registrant is nonetheless bound as aprincipal by all terms and conditions herein, including the DisputePolicy.G.      Limitation of Liability. Registrant agrees that <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> shall haveno liability to the Registrant for any loss Registrant may incur inconnection with <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN>'s processing of this Registration Agreement, inconnection with <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN>'s processing of any authorized modification to thedomain name's record during the covered period, as a result of theRegistrant's <SPANCLASS="acronym">ISP</SPAN>'s failure to pay either the initial registration feeor renewal fee, or as a result of the application of the provisions ofthe Dispute Policy. Registrant agrees that in no event shall themaximum liability of <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> under this Agreement for any matter exceedFive Hundred United States Dollars (<SPANCLASS="acronym">US</SPAN>$500).H.      Indemnity. Registrant agrees, in the event the RegistrationAgreement is accepted by <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> and a subsequent dispute arises with anythird party, to indemnify and hold <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> harmless pursuant to the termsand conditions contained in the Dispute Policy.I.      Breach. Registrant agrees that failure to abide by anyprovision of this Registration Agreement or the Dispute Policy may beconsidered by <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> to be a material breach and that <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> may provide awritten notice, describing the breach, to the Registrant. If, withinthirty (30) days of the date of mailing such notice, the Registrantfails to provide evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN>,that it has not breached its obligations, then <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> may deleteRegistrant's registration of the domain name. Any such breach by aRegistrant shall not be deemed to be excused simply because <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> didnot act earlier in response to that, or any other, breach by theRegistrant.J.      No Guaranty. Registrant agrees that, by registration of adomain name, such registration does not confer immunity from objectionto either the registration or use of the domain name.K.      Warranty. Registrant warrants by submitting this RegistrationAgreement that, to the best of Registrant's knowledge and belief, theinformation submitted herein is true and correct, and that any futurechanges to this information will be provided to <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> in a timely manneraccording to the domain name modification procedures in place at thattime. Breach of this warranty will constitute a material breach.L.      Revocation. Registrant agrees that <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> may delete aRegistrant's domain name if this Registration Agreement, or subsequentmodification(s) thereto, contains false or misleading information, orconceals or omits any information <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> would likely consider materialto its decision to approve this Registration Agreement.M.      Right of Refusal. <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN>, in its sole discretion, reserves theright to refuse to approve the Registration Agreement for anyRegistrant. Registrant agrees that the submission of this RegistrationAgreement does not obligate <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> to accept this Registration Agreement.Registrant agrees that <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> shall not be liable for loss or damagesthat may result from <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN>'s refusal to accept this RegistrationAgreement.N.      Severability. Registrant agrees that the terms of thisRegistration Agreement are severable. If any term or provision isdeclared invalid, it shall not affect the remaining terms orprovisions which shall continue to be binding.O.      Entirety. Registrant agrees that this Registration Agreementand the Dispute Policy is the complete and exclusive agreement betweenRegistrant and <SPANCLASS="acronym">NSI</SPAN> regarding the registration of Registrant's domainname. This Registration Agreement and the Dispute Policy supersede allprior agreements and understandings, whether established by custom,practice, policy, or precedent.P.      Governing Law.

By submitting this Registration Agreement,Registrant consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of theUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia,Alexandria Division.
