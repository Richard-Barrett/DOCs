The intent of this domain is toprovide a guaranteed method to perform host address to host name mapping, and tofacilitate queries to locate all gateways on a particular network in theInternet.  Whenever an application is used that requires user identification,i.e., ftp, or remote login, the domain must be registered in the IN-ADDR.ARPAzone or the application will be unable to determine the origin of the IP.IN-ADDR domains are represented using the network number in reverse.        EXAMPLE: The IN-ADDR domain for network 123.45.67.0 is represented as                                67.45.123.IN-ADDR.ARPA.        NOTE:  Please do not list your network number in reverse on your template.Use the above template for registering new IN-ADDR entries, making changes toexisting IN-ADDR records, and removing inverse-address mapping from the ARINdatabase and root servers.The IN-ADDR template should be submitted via E-mail to ARIN at:                hostmaster@arin.netIn order to ensure prompt and accurate processing of IN-ADDR requests, followprecisely the instructions below.  Please do not modify the template nor removethe version number.  IN-ADDR templates are automatically parsed.  Errors in atemplate result in the template being returned for correction.Please send only one template per message.  In the Subject of the message, usethe words: NEW IN-ADDR, MODIFY IN-ADDR, or REMOVE IN-ADDR, as appropriate.Please do not send hardcopy registrations to ARIN.  If you do not have an E-mailconnection, you should arrange for your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to sendE-mail applications to ARIN on your behalf.When you submit a template, you will receive an auto-reply from ARIN with aticket number.  The ticket number format is:                ARIN -&lt;year&gt;&lt;month&gt;&lt;day&gt;.&lt;queue position&gt;.Use the ticket number in the Subject of any message you send regarding aregistration action.  When the registration has been completed, you will benotified via E-mail.All ISPs receiving from ARIN /16 CIDR blocks (Class B) which are greater than orequal to (&gt;= )256 Class C's) will be responsible for maintaining allIN-ADDR.ARPA domain records for their respective customers.  The ISP isresponsible for the maintenance of IN-ADDR.ARPA domain records of all longerprefixes that have been delegated out of that block.DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING EACH IN-ADDR TEMPLATE FIELDSection 0.   Registration Action TypeN) New (M) Modify (D) Delete:(N)  New:     For new IN-ADDR registration, place an N after the colon.(M)  Modify:     To modify/change an EXISTING record IN-ADDR registration, place an M after     the colon. When &quot;M&quot; is selected, the current records will be replaced with     the information listed in the template.  Please provide a complete list of     name servers in the order in which they should appear on the record.     If the modification involves first registering a person or name server(s)     not entered in the database, the instructions for completing Sections 2,     3, 4 and 5 apply.  Search the WHOIS database for more information if you     are unsure of the current information for the technical POC or name     server(s).     The requested changes will be made if ARIN registry personnel determine     that the modification request was issued by an authorized source. The     issuing source may be a listed contact for the domain, others in the same     organization, the current provider, or a new provider initiating network     support.(D)  Delete.     To delete an existing IN-ADDR from your network record, place a D after     the colon.  List the IN-ADDR server and IP number and it will be deleted.     The host entry will still exist in the global host tables.Section 1.  Network Record Information.1a.  Network Name.     Please supply the network name.        NOTE:  The network name is not the domain name.     To verify an existing Network Name, use the searchable WHOIS database.     The Network Name is used as an identifier in Internet name and address     tables.  To create a network name, supply a short name consisting of a     combination of up to 12 numbers and letters for the network.  You may use     a dash (-) as part of the Network Name, but no other special characters.     Please do not use periods or underscores.1b./1c.   Start/End of Network Block.1b.  Start of Network Block.     If the network record is for a single network, enter the IP address of     the single network here.  Item 1c is then left blank.  If the record is     a block of IP addresses, enter the IP address of the start of the     network block.1c.  End of Network Block.     If the network record is a block of IP addresses, Item 1c will be the     last IP address of the network block.     If you received a block of IP addresses from your ISP, there may already     be IN-ADDR servers on the parent block held by that provider.     Please query your ISP before submitting an IN-ADDR request.Section 2.  Name and Postal Address of Organization.2a.  Name of Organization.     The network is considered to be registered to an organization, even if     the &quot;organization&quot; is an individual.  If you are an ISP submitting     this request on behalf of your customer, please provide here the     name and postal address of the organization that uses the IP address(es).2b.  Postal Address of Organization.     This is the physical address of the organization.  Place the city, state,     and zip code together on the same line below the Street Address or Post     Office Box.  Use a comma to separate the city and state.  Do not insert     a period following the state abbreviation.  To change an address, please     provide the new address information in this item, and flag the change in     Section 6: Comments.        EXAMPLE:                   111 Town Center Drive                   Herndon, VA 22070     If the organization is located in a country other than the United States,     please include the two-letter country code on the last line by itself.     EXAMPLE:               161 James Street               Montreal, QC H2S 2C8               CA     For the country entry, please use the two-letter country code found at:                URL:  [ftp://rs.arin.net/netinfo/iso3166-countrycodes]     NOTE:  If you wish to make a change to an existing registered physical            address of an organization, please note the change you want in            Section 6: Comments.Section 3.  Technical Contact     The technical point of contact (POC) is the person responsible for     the technical aspects of maintaining the network's name servers.     The POC should be able to answer any utilization questions ARIN may have.3a.  User Handle (if known)     Each person in the ARIN database is assigned a user handle, which is a     unique tag consisting of the user's initials and a serial number.  This     tag is used in database records indicate a POC for a domain name, network,     name server or other entity.  Each user should have only one handle.     If the user handle is known, insert the handle in Item 3a and leave the     rest of Section 3 blank.  If the user's handle is unknown or the user has     never been registered, leave Item 3a blank.  The user's database record     will be updated with any new information on the template.3b.  Name (Last, First)     Enter the name of the Technical Contact in the format:                     Last Name, First Name.     Separate first and last names by a comma.3c.  Organization.     Provide the name of the organization with which the Technical Contact     is affiliated. Refer to the instructions for Item 2a.3d.   Postal Address.     Refer to the instructions for Item 2b.Section 4.   Primary Name Server.Networks are required to provide at least two independent servers fortranslating address to name mapping for hosts in the domain.  The servers shouldbe in physically separate locations and on different networks, if possible.  Theservers should be active and responsive to domain name server (DNS) queriesprior to submission of this application.ARIN requires that you provide complete information on your primary andsecondary servers in order to process your registration request. Incompleteinformation in sections 4 and 5, or inactive servers will result in the returnof the registration request.NOTE:  To change the name or the number of a registered name server, submit       a separate IN-ADDR template requesting a modification of your IN-ADDR       registration.  Do this by placing an M after the Modify command in       Section 0:  Registration Action Type. New IN-ADDR registrations cannot       be used to change the name or the number of a registered name server.4a.  Primary Name Server Hostname.     Please provide the fully-qualified name of the machine that is to be     the name server.        EXAMPLE:                   Use &quot;machine.domainame.com&quot; not just &quot;machine&quot; or just&quot;domainame.com&quot;                   Many reverse-authentication programs will not search for thenameserver if only the domain name is listed.4b.  Primary Name Server Netaddress.     It is suggested that the fourth octet of an IP address of a server     should be neither 0 nor 255.  The remaining 254 numbers in the fourth     octet of the IP address are valid.Section 5.  Secondary Name Server(s)5a./5b.  Secondary Name Server Hostname/Secondary Name Server Netaddress.     Please refer to the instructions and examples in Items 4a./4b. above.     Copy Section 5 as needed to include all Secondary Name Servers.     Do not renumber or change the copied section.  A maximum of six domain     name servers may be added to a network record.Section 6.  Comments.Please use Section 6 to provide ARIN with all comments and any additionaldetailed updates relevant to your IN-ADDR registration not provided in Sections0 through 5. Please provide a brief explanation for changing an organizationname or point of contact information.</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-20535"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-20536"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-20537"></A></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="APPENDIX"HREF="appd_01.htm"TITLE="D.
