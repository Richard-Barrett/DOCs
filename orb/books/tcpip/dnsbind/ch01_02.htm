The Internet, with acapital <SPANCLASS="quote">"I,"</SPAN> refers to the network that began its life asthe <SPANCLASS="acronym">ARPA</SPAN>net and continues today as, roughly, theconfederation of all <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN>/<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>networks directly or indirectly connected to commercialU.S. backbones.

A single file,<ICLASS="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I>, contained all the information youneeded to know about those hosts: it held a name-to-address mappingfor every host connected to the <SPANCLASS="acronym">ARPA</SPAN>net. Thefamiliar <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> host table,<ICLASS="filename">/etc/hosts</I>, was compiled from<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-437"></A><ICLASS="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I> (mostly by deleting fields that<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> didn't use).</P><PCLASS="para"><ICLASS="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I> was maintained by<SPANCLASS="acronym">SRI</SPAN>'s<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-444"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-447"></A><ICLASS="firstterm">Network Information Center</I> (dubbed <SPANCLASS="quote">"the<SPANCLASS="acronym">NIC</SPAN>"</SPAN>) and distributed from a single host,<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-454"></A><ICLASS="systemitem.sitename"><SPANCLASS="acronym">SRI-NIC</SPAN></I>.[1] <SPANCLASS="acronym">ARPA</SPAN>net administrators typicallyemailed their changes to the <SPANCLASS="acronym">NIC</SPAN>, and periodically<KBDCLASS="command">ftp</KBD>ed to <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename"><SPANCLASS="acronym">SRI-NIC</SPAN></I> and grabbed thecurrent <ICLASS="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I>.  Their changes were compiledinto a new <ICLASS="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I> once or twice a week. As the<SPANCLASS="acronym">ARPA</SPAN>net grew, however, this scheme becameunworkable.  The size of <ICLASS="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I> grew inproportion to the growth in the number of <SPANCLASS="acronym">ARPA</SPAN>nethosts. Moreover, the traffic generated by the update process increasedeven faster: every additional host meant not only another line in<ICLASS="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I>, but potentially another host updatingfrom <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename"><SPANCLASS="acronym">SRI-NIC</SPAN></I>.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] <SPANCLASS="acronym">SRI</SPAN> is the Stanford Research Institute inMenlo Park, California. <SPANCLASS="acronym">SRI</SPAN> conducts research intomany different areas, including computer networking.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">And when the <SPANCLASS="acronym">ARPA</SPAN>net moved to the<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN>/<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> protocols, the populationof the network exploded.

However, while the <SPANCLASS="acronym">NIC</SPAN> could assignaddresses in a way that guaranteed uniqueness, it had no authorityover host names. There was nothing to prevent someone from adding ahost with a conflicting name and breaking the whole scheme. Someoneadding a host with the same name as a major mail hub, for example,could disrupt mail service to much of the<SPANCLASS="acronym">ARPA</SPAN>net.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term">Consistency</DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-509"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-512"></A>Maintaining consistency of the file across an expanding networkbecame harder and harder. By the time a new<ICLASS="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I> could reach the farthest shores of theenlarged <SPANCLASS="acronym">ARPA</SPAN>net, a host across the network hadchanged addresses, or a new host had sprung up that users wanted toreach.</P></DD></DL><PCLASS="para">The essential problem was that the<ICLASS="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I> mechanism didn't scalewell. Ironically, the success of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">ARPA</SPAN>net as anexperiment led to the failure and obsolescence of<ICLASS="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I>.</P><PCLASS="para">The <SPANCLASS="acronym">ARPA</SPAN>net's governing bodies chartered aninvestigation into a successor for<ICLASS="filename">HOSTS.TXT</I>. Their goal was to create a system thatsolved the problems inherent in a unified host table system. The newsystem should allow local administration of data, yet make that dataglobally available. The decentralization of administration wouldeliminate the single-host bottleneck and relieve the trafficproblem. And local management would make the task of keeping dataup-to-date much easier. It should use a hierarchical name space toname hosts.  This would ensure the uniqueness of names.</P><PCLASS="para">Paul<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-524"></A>Mockapetris, then of <SPANCLASS="acronym">USC</SPAN>'s InformationSciences Institute, was responsible for designing the architecture ofthe new system.
