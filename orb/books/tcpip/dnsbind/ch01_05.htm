There areother name resolution mechanisms besides <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN>, someof which may be standard with your operating system. Sometimes theoverhead involved in managing a domain and its name servers outweighsthe benefits. On the other hand, there are circumstances in which youhave no other choice but to set up and manage a domain. Here are someguidelines to help you make that decision:</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-686">1.5.1 If you're connected to the Internet...</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-689"></A>...<SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> is a must. Think of <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> asthe <ICLASS="foreignphrase">lingua franca</I> of the Internet:nearly all of the Internet's network services use<SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN>. That includes the World Wide Web, electronicmail, remote terminal access, and file transfer.</P><PCLASS="para">On the other hand, this doesn't necessarily mean that you haveto set up and run a domain <EMCLASS="emphasis">by</EM> yourself <EMCLASS="emphasis">for</EM> yourself. If you've onlygot a handful of hosts, you may be able to find an existing domain tobecome part of (see <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch03_01.htm"TITLE="Where Do I Start?">Chapter 3, <CITECLASS="chapter">Where Do I Start?</CITE></A>). Or you may be ableto find someone else to run a domain for you. If you pay an Internetservice provider for your Internet connectivity, ask if they'll managea domain for you, too. Even if you aren't already a customer, thereare companies who will help out, for a price.</P><PCLASS="para">If you have a little more than a handful of hosts, or a lotmore, then you'll probably want your own domain. And if you wantdirect control over your domain and your name servers, then you'llwant to manage it yourself. Buy this book and read on!</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-702">1.5.2 If you have a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UUCP</SPAN> connection to a host onthe Internet...</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-706"></A>...it's a good idea to set up a domain. <ICLASS="systemitem.example">user@domain</I>-style addressing has becomestandard on the Internet. Once you've set up a domain, yourcorrespondents on the Internet will be able to send you mail usingthese simpler addresses. You'll also be prepared if you decide laterto get a connection to the Internet.</P><PCLASS="para">It's a common misconception that you actually need to beconnected to the Internet to set up a domain and use <ICLASS="systemitem.example">user@domain</I> addresses. You'll need hosts onthe Internet to act as name servers for your domain, but they don'thave to be <EMCLASS="emphasis">your</EM> hosts. You'd be surprised how many people are willingto <SPANCLASS="quote">"host"</SPAN> your domain gratis: the Internet is still afairly neighborly place. (And even if you can't find anyone willing,there are companies who will do it for you for cheap.)</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-715">1.5.3 If you have your own<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-717"></A><SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN>/<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>-basedinternet...</A></H3><PCLASS="para">...you probably want <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN>. By an internet, wedon't mean just a single Ethernet of workstations using<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN>/<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> (see the next section ifyou thought that was what we meant); we mean a fairly complex<SPANCLASS="quote">"network of networks."</SPAN> Maybe you have a forest ofAppletalk nets and a handful of Apollo token rings.</P><PCLASS="para">If your internet is basically homogeneous and your hosts don'tneed <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> (say you have a big<SPANCLASS="acronym">DEC</SPAN>net or <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN> internet), thenyou may be able to do without it. But if you've got a variety ofhosts, especially if some of those run some variety of<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>, you'll want <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN>. It'llsimplify the distribution of host information and rid you of anykludgy host table distribution schemes you may have cooked up.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-736">1.5.4 If you have your own local area network or sitenetwork...</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-739"></A>...and that network isn't connected to a larger network, you can probablyget away without using <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN>. You might considerusing Microsoft's Windows Internet Name Service(<SPANCLASS="acronym">WINS</SPAN>), host tables, or Sun's Network InformationService (<SPANCLASS="acronym">NIS</SPAN>) product.</P><PCLASS="para">But if you need distributed administration or have troublemaintaining the consistency of data on your network,<SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> may be for you. And if your network is likelyto be connected to another network soon, like your corporate internetor the Internet, it'd be wise to start up a domain now.</P><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-749"></A></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_04.htm"TITLE="1.4 The History of BIND"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 1.4 The History of BIND"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="DNS &amp; BIND"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="CHAPTER"HREF="ch02_01.htm"TITLE="2.
