In other words, you need to find out where you fit in theInternet domain name space, and decide what you'd like to call yourparticular corner of that name space.</P><PCLASS="para">The first step in picking a domain name is finding where in theexisting domain name space you belong. It's easiest to start at thetop and work your way down: decide which top-level domain you belongin, then which of that top-level domain's subdomains you fitinto.</P><PCLASS="para">Note that in order to find out what the Internet domain namespace looks like (beyond what we've already told you), you'll needaccess to the Internet. You don't need access to a host that alreadyhas Domain Name Service configured, but it would help a little. If youdon't have access to a host with <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> configured,you'll have to <SPANCLASS="quote">"borrow"</SPAN> name service from other nameservers (as in our previous <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">ftp.isc.org</I> example) to get yougoing.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-2051">3.2.1 Where in the World Do I Fit?</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="DNS3-IDX-3-TOP-LEVEL-DOMAINS-CHOOSING"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="DNS3-IDX-3-GEOGRAPHIC-DOMAIN-NAMES-CHOOSING"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="DNS3-IDX-3-INTERNATIONALIZATION-GEOGRAPHIC-DOMAIN-NAMES-CHOOSING"></A>If your organization is attached to the Internet outside of the UnitedStates, you first need to decide whether you'd rather request a domainunder the generic top-level domains, like <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">com</I> and <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">edu</I>, or under your country's top-leveldomain.  The generic top-level domains, even though some are usedlargely <EMCLASS="emphasis">by</EM> U.S. organizations, aren't exclusively<EMCLASS="emphasis">for</EM> U.S. organizations. If your company is amulti- or transnational company, you may wish to join a generictop-level domain, or if you'd simply prefer a generic top-level toyour country's top-level domain, you're welcome to ask to join one. Ifyou choose this route, skip to the section <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch03_02.htm#DNS3-CHP-GTLD"TITLE="The generic top-level domains">Section 3.2.2.2, "The generic top-level domains</A>&quot; later in this chapter.</P><PCLASS="para">If you opt for a<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2070"></A>subdomain under your country's top level, youshould check whether your country's top-level domain is registered,and if it is, what kind of structure it has. Consult our list of thecurrent top-level domains (<ACLASS="xref"HREF="appc_01.htm"TITLE="Top-Level Domains">Appendix C, <CITECLASS="appendix">Top-Level Domains</CITE></A>) if you're notsure what the name of your country's top-level domain would be.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2075"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2078"></A>Some countries' top-level domains, like New Zealand's <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">nz</I>, Australia's <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">au</I>, and the United Kingdom's <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">uk</I>, are divided organizationally intosecond-level domains. The names of their second-level domains, like<ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">co</I> or <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">com</I> for commercial entities, reflectorganizational affiliation. Others, like France's <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">fr</I> domain, and Canada's <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">ca</I> domain, are divided into a multitudeof subdomains managed by individual universities and companies, likethe University of St. Etienne's domain, <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">univ-st-etienne.fr</I> and Bell NorthernResearch's <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">bnr.ca</I>. You'llhave to use a tool like <KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD> to grope aroundand discover your top-level domain's structure if it isn'twell-known. (If you're uncomfortable with our rushing headlong into<KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD> without giving it a proper introduction,you might skim <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch11_01.htm"TITLE="nslookup">Chapter 11, <CITECLASS="chapter">nslookup</CITE></A>.)

For example, the network 15/8 is madeup of all <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> addresses in the range 15.0.0.0 to15.255.255.255.  The network 199.10.25/24 starts at 199.10.25.0 andends at 199.10.25.255.</P><DIVCLASS="sidebar"><H4CLASS="sidebar"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-2460">A Sidebar on <SPANCLASS="acronym">CIDR</SPAN></A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2464"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2466"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2468"></A>Once upon a time, when we wrote the first edition of this book,the Internet's 32-bit address space was divided up into three mainclasses of networks: class A, class B, and class C.  Class A networkswere networks in which the first octet (first eight bits) of the<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> address identified the network, and theremaining bits were used by the organization assigned the network todifferentiate hosts on the network.  Most organizations with class Anetworks also subdivided their networks into subnetworks, or subnets,adding another level of hierarchy to the addressing scheme.  Class Bnetworks devoted two octets to the network identifier and two to thehost; class C networks gave three octets to the network identifier andone to the host.</P><PCLASS="para">Unfortunately, this small/medium/large system of networks didn'twork well for everyone.  Many organizations were large enough torequire several class C networks, which could accommodate at most 254hosts, but too small to warrant a full class B network, which couldserve 65534 hosts.  Many of these organizations were allocated class Bnetworks, anyway.  Consequently, class B networks quickly becamescarce.</P><PCLASS="para">To help solve this problem, and create networks that were justthe right size for all sorts of organizations, Classless Inter-DomainRouting, or <SPANCLASS="acronym">CIDR</SPAN> (pronounced <SPANCLASS="quote">"cider"</SPAN>)was developed.  As the name implies, <SPANCLASS="acronym">CIDR</SPAN> does awaywith the old class A, class B, and class C network designations.Instead of allocating either one, two, or three octets to the networkidentifier, the allocator could allocate any number of contiguous bitsof the <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> address to the network identifier.  So,for example, if an organization needed an address space roughly fourtimes as large as a class B network, the powers-that-be could assignit a network identifier of 14 bits, leaving 18 bits (four class Bs'worth) of space to use.</P><PCLASS="para">Naturally, the advent of <SPANCLASS="acronym">CIDR</SPAN> made the<SPANCLASS="quote">"classful"</SPAN> terminology outdated&nbsp;- although it's still useda good deal in casual conversation.  Now, to designate a particular<SPANCLASS="acronym">CIDR</SPAN> network, we specify the particular high-orderbit value assigned to an organization, expressed in dotted octetnotation, and how many bits identify the network.  The two terms areseparated by a slash.  So 15/8 is the old, class A-sized network thatbegins with the bit pattern 00001111.  The old, class B-sized network128.32.0.0 is now 128.32/16.  And the network 192.168.0.128/25consists of the 128 <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> addresses from 192.168.0.128to 192.168.0.255.</P></DIV><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2484"></A>The Inter<SPANCLASS="acronym">NIC</SPAN> was once the official source ofall <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> networks; they assigned all<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> networks to Internet-connected networks and madesure no two ranges overlapped. Nowadays, theInter<SPANCLASS="acronym">NIC</SPAN>'s old role has been largely assumed byInternet Service Providers (<SPANCLASS="acronym">ISP</SPAN>s), who allocatespace from their own networks for customers to use.  If you know yournetwork came from your <SPANCLASS="acronym">ISP</SPAN>, the larger network fromwhich your network was carved is probably registered (to your<SPANCLASS="acronym">ISP</SPAN>).  You may still want to double-check that your<SPANCLASS="acronym">ISP</SPAN> took care of registering their network, but youdon't (and probably can't) do anything yourself, except nag your<SPANCLASS="acronym">ISP</SPAN> if they didn't register their network.

These organizations, called (what else?)<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="DNS3-IDX-3-REGISTRIES"></A>registries, each handle network registration in some part of theworld.
