A simple analogy should help here: imagine thata mail exchanger is an airport, and instead of setting up<SPANCLASS="acronym">MX</SPAN> records to instruct mailers where to sendmessages, you're advising your in-laws on which airport to fly intowhen they come visit you.</P><PCLASS="para">Say you live in Los Gatos, California. The closest airport foryour in-laws to fly into is San Jose, the second closest is SanFrancisco, and the third Oakland. (We'll ignore other factors likeprice of the ticket, Bay Area traffic, etc.) Don't see the parallel?Then picture it like this:</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="screen"><PRECLASS="screen">los-gatos.ca.us.    IN    MX    1 san-jose.ca.us.los-gatos.ca.us.    IN    MX    2 san-francisco.ca.us.los-gatos.ca.us.    IN    MX    3 oakland.ca.us.</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">The <SPANCLASS="acronym">MX</SPAN> list is just an ordered list ofdestinations that tells mailers (your in-laws) where to send messages(fly) if they want to reach a given domain (your house). Thepreference value tells them how desirable it is to use thatdestination&nbsp;- you can think of it as a logical<SPANCLASS="quote">"distance"</SPAN> from the eventual destination (in any unitsyou choose), or simply as a <SPANCLASS="quote">"top-ten"</SPAN>-style ranking ofthe proximity of those mail exchangers to the finaldestination.</P><PCLASS="para">With this list, you're saying, <SPANCLASS="quote">"Try to fly into San Jose,and if you can't get there, try San Francisco and Oakland, in thatorder."</SPAN> It <EMCLASS="emphasis">also</EM> says that if you reach SanFrancisco, you should take a commuter flight to San Jose. If you windup in Oakland, you should try to get a commuter to San Jose, or atleast to San Francisco.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4249"></A>What makes a good mail exchanger, then? The same qualities that make agood airport:</P><DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term">Size</DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">You wouldn't want to fly into tiny Reid-Hillview Airport to getto Los Gatos, because the airport's not equipped to handle largeplanes or many people. (You'd probably be better off landing a big jeton Highway 280 than at Reid-Hillview.) Likewise, you don't want to usean emaciated, underpowered host as a mail exchanger; it won't be ableto handle the load.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term">Uptime</DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">You know better than to fly through Denver International Airportin the winter, right? Then you should know better than to use a hostthat's rarely up or available as a mail exchanger.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term">Connectivity</DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4265"></A>If your relatives are flying in from far away, you've got to make surethey can get a direct flight to at least one of the airports in thelist you give them. You can't tell them their only choices are SanJose and Oakland if they're flying in from Helsinki. Similarly, you'vegot to make sure that at least one of your hosts' mail exchangers isreachable to anyone who might conceivably send you mail.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term">Management and administration</DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4271"></A>How well an airport is managed has a bearing on your safety whileflying into or just through the airport, and on how easy it is touse. Think of these factors when choosing a mail exchanger. Theprivacy of your mail, the speed of its delivery during normaloperations, and how well your mail is treated when your hosts go downall hinge upon the quality of the administrators who manage your mailexchangers.</P></DD></DL><PCLASS="para">Keep this example in mind, because we'll use it againlater.</P><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4275"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4276"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4277"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4278"></A></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch05_01.htm"TITLE="5.1 MX Records"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 5.1 MX Records"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="DNS &amp; BIND"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch05_03.htm"TITLE="5.3 The MX Algorithm"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 5.3 The MX Algorithm"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">5.1 MX Records</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">5.3 The MX Algorithm</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
