Forexample, if your company has four branch offices, you might decide tocreate four subdomains, each of which corresponds to a branchoffice.</P><PCLASS="para">Should you create subdomains for each site, for each division,or even for each department? You have a lot of latitude in your choicebecause of <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN>'s scalability. You can create a fewlarge subdomains or many small subdomains. There are trade-offswhichever you choose, though.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-9350"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-9353"></A>Delegating to a few large subdomains isn't much work for the parentdomain, because there's not much delegation to keep track of. However,you wind up with larger subdomains, which require more memory andfaster name servers, and administration isn't as distributed. If youimplement site-level subdomains, for example, you may force autonomousor unrelated groups at a site to share a single name space and asingle point of administration.</P><PCLASS="para">Delegating to many smaller subdomains can be a headache for theadministrator of the parent.  Keeping delegation data current involveskeeping track of which hosts run name servers and which zones they'reauthoritative for.  The data change each time a subdomain adds a newname server, or when the address of a name server for the subdomainchanges. If the subdomains are all administered by different people,that means more administrators to train, more relationships for theparent administrator to maintain, and more overhead for theorganization overall. On the other hand, the subdomains are smallerand easier to manage, and the administration is more widelydistributed, allowing closer management of subdomain data.</P><PCLASS="para">Given the advantages and disadvantages of either alternative, itmay seem difficult to make a choice. Actually, though, there'sprobably a natural division in your organization. Some companiesmanage computers and networks at the site level; others havedecentralized, relatively autonomous workgroups that manage everythingthemselves. Here are a few basic rules to help you find the right wayto carve up your name space:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Don't shoehorn your organization into a weird or uncomfortabledomain structure. Trying to fit 50 independent, unrelatedU.S. divisions into 4 regional subdomains may save you work (as theadministrator of the parent zone), but it won't help yourreputation. Decentralized, autonomous operations demand differentdomains&nbsp;- that's the <ICLASS="foreignphrase">raison d'être</I>of the Domain Name System.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">The structure of your domain should mirror the structure of yourorganization, especially your organization's<EMCLASS="emphasis">support</EM> structure.  If departments run networks,assign <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> addresses, and manage hosts, thendepartments should manage the subdomains.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If you're not sure or can't agree about how the namespace shouldbe organized, try to come up with guidelines for when a group withinyour organization can carve off their own subdomain (e.g., how manyhosts do you need to create a new subdomain, what level of supportmust the group provide) and grow the namespace organically, only asneeded.</P></LI></UL></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch09_01.htm"TITLE="9.1 When to Become a Parent"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 9.1 When to Become a Parent"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="DNS &amp; BIND"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch09_03.htm"TITLE="9.3 What to Name Your Children"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 9.3 What to Name Your Children"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">9.1 When to Become a Parent</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">9.3 What to Name Your Children</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
