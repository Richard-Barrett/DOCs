Recursion is the default with <KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD>,so you have to explicitly turn it off. The difference in<EMCLASS="emphasis">operation</EM> between a resolver and a name server isthat the resolver implements the search list, and the name serverdoesn't. By default, <KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD> implements the searchlist, so that, too, has to be turned off.

If it doesn't have the answer, andit is authoritative for the domain, the name server responds that thename doesn't exist or that there is no data for that type. If the nameserver doesn't have the answer, and it is <EMCLASS="emphasis">not</EM>authoritative for the domain, it starts walking up the domain treelooking for <SPANCLASS="acronym">NS</SPAN> records. There will always be<SPANCLASS="acronym">NS</SPAN> records somewhere higher in the domain tree.

On the other hand, if the original query was arecursive query, the name server would then query the remote nameservers in the <SPANCLASS="acronym">NS</SPAN> records that it found. When thename server receives a response from one of the remote name servers,it caches the response, and repeats this process, if necessary.

The <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">gov</I> name serverwould have answered the question out of its cache instead of referringyou to the <ICLASS="systemitem.sitename">whitehouse.gov</I>name servers. Why is this significant? Suppose you messed up aparticular host's address in your zone. Someone points it out to you,and you clean up the problem.  Even though your name server now hasthe correct data, some remote sites find the old, messed-up data whenthey look up the name. One of the name servers higher up in the domaintree, such as a root name server, has cached the incorrect data; whenit receives a query for that host's address, it returns the incorrectdata instead of referring the querier to your name servers. What makesthis problem hard to track down is that only one of the <SPANCLASS="quote">"higherup"</SPAN> name servers has cached the incorrect data, so only some ofthe remote lookups get the wrong answer&nbsp;- the ones that use thisserver. Fun, huh? Eventually, though, the <SPANCLASS="quote">"higher up"</SPAN>name server will time out the old record.  If you're pressed for time,you can contact the administrators of the remote name server and askthem to kill and restart <KBDCLASS="command">named</KBD> to flush thecache. Of course, if the remote name server is an important, much-usedname server, they may tell you where to go with that suggestion.</P><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-12623"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-12624"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-12625"></A></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-12626">11.6.3 Zone Transfers</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-12629"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-12632"></A><KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD> can be used to transfer a whole zone usingthe<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-12636"></A><KBDCLASS="command">ls</KBD> command.
