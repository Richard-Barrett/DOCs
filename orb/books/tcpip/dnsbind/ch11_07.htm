Unfortunately, some types of failures render the troubleshootingtool mostly useless.  Other types of <KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD>failures are, at best, confusing because they don't give you anydirect information to work with. While there may be a few problemswith <KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD> itself, most of the problems youencounter will be with name server configuration and operation. We'llcover a few odd problems here.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-12665">11.7.1 Looking Up the Right Data</A></H3><PCLASS="para">This isn't really a problem, <ICLASS="foreignphrase">per se</I>,but it can be awfully confusing.

If you see that the address of your serveris 0.0.0.0, <KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD> grabbed the system's host name(what the <KBDCLASS="command">hostname</KBD> command returns) for the serverfield and gave you its prompt. It is only when you try to look upsomething that you find out that there is no server responding. Inthis case, it is pretty obvious that there is no name serverrunning&nbsp;- a name server ought to be able to look up its ownname. If you are looking up some remote information, though, the nameserver could fail to respond because it is still trying to look up theitem and <KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD> gave up waiting. How can you tellthe difference between a name server that isn't running and a nameserver that is running but didn't respond?
