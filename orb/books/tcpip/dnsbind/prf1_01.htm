Every time you send electronic mailor surf the World Wide Web, you rely on the Domain Name System.</P><PCLASS="para">You see, while you, as a human being, prefer to remember the<EMCLASS="emphasis">names</EM> of computers, computers like to address each other by number. Onan internet, that number is 32 bits long, or between zero and fourbillion or so.[1] That's easy for a computer to remember, because computershave lots of memory ideal for storing numbers, but it isn't nearly aseasy for us humans. Pick ten phone numbers out of the phone book atrandom, and then try to remember them. Not easy? Now flip to the frontof the book and attach random area codes to the phone numbers. That'sabout how difficult it would be to remember ten arbitrary internetaddresses.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1]  And, with <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> version 6, it's soon to be awhopping 128 bits long, or between zero and a decimal number with 39digits.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">This is part of the reason we need the Domain NameSystem. <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> handles mapping between host names,which we humans find convenient, and internet addresses, whichcomputers deal with.  In fact, <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> is the standardmechanism on the Internet for advertising and accessing all kinds ofinformation about hosts, not just addresses.  And<SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> is used by virtually all internetworkingsoftware, including electronic mail, remote terminal programs such as<KBDCLASS="command">telnet</KBD>, file transfer programs such as<KBDCLASS="command">ftp</KBD>, and web browsers such as Netscape Navigatorand Microsoft Internet Explorer.</P><PCLASS="para">Another important feature of <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> is that itmakes host information available <EMCLASS="emphasis">all over</EM> the Internet. Keepinginformation about hosts in a formatted file on a single computer onlyhelps users on that computer. <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> provides a meansof retrieving information remotely, from anywhere on thenetwork.</P><PCLASS="para">More than that, <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> lets you distribute themanagement of host information among many sites and organizations.You don't need to submit your data to some central site orperiodically retrieve copies of the <SPANCLASS="quote">"master"</SPAN>database. You simply make sure your section, called a<ICLASS="firstterm">zone</I>, is up to date on your <ICLASS="firstterm">nameservers</I>. Your name servers make your zone's data availableto all the other name servers on the network.</P><PCLASS="para">Because the database is distributed, the system also needs theability to locate the data you're looking for by searching a number ofpossible locations. The Domain Name System gives name servers theintelligence to navigate through the database and find data in anyzone.</P><PCLASS="para">Of course, <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> does have a few problems. Forexample, the system allows more than one name server to store dataabout a zone, for redundancy's sake. But inconsistencies can crop upbetween copies of the zone data.</P><PCLASS="para">But the <EMCLASS="emphasis">worst</EM> problem with<SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> is that despite its widespread use on theInternet, there's really very little<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-54"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-57"></A>documentation about managing and maintaining it. Most administratorson the Internet make do with the documentation their vendors see fitto provide, and with whatever they can glean from following theInternet mailing lists and Usenet newsgroups on the subject.</P><PCLASS="para">This lack of documentation means that the understanding of anenormously important internet service&nbsp;- one of the linchpins oftoday's Internet&nbsp;- is either handed down from administrator toadministrator like a closely-guarded family recipe, or relearnedrepeatedly by isolated programmers and engineers. New administratorsof domains suffer through the same mistakes made by countlessothers.</P><PCLASS="para">Our aim with this book is to help remedy this situation. Werealize that not all of you have the time or the desire to become<SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> experts. Most of you, after all, have plenty todo besides managing a domain or a name server: system administration,network engineering, or software development. It takes an awfully biginstitution to devote a whole person to <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN>. We'lltry to give you enough information to allow you to do what you need todo, whether that's running a small domain or managing a multinationalmonstrosity, tending a single name server or shepherding a hundred ofthem. Read as much as you need to know now, and come back later if youneed to know more.</P><PCLASS="para"><SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> is a big topic&nbsp;- big enough torequire two authors, anyway&nbsp;- but we've tried to present it assensibly and understandably as possible.  The first two chapters giveyou a good theoretical overview and enough practical information toget by, and later chapters fill in the nitty-gritty details. Weprovide a roadmap up front, to suggest a path through the bookappropriate for your job or interest.</P><PCLASS="para">When we talk about actual <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> software, we'llconcentrate almost exclusively on <SPANCLASS="acronym">BIND</SPAN>, theBerkeley Internet Name Domain software, which is the most popularimplementation of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> specs (and the one weknow best). We've tried to distill our experience in managing andmaintaining a domain with <SPANCLASS="acronym">BIND</SPAN> into thisbook&nbsp;- a domain, incidentally, that is one of the largest on theInternet. (We don't mean to brag, but we can use the credibility.)Where possible, we've included the real programs that we use inadministration, many of them rewritten into Perl for speed andefficiency.</P><PCLASS="para">We hope that this book will help you get acquainted with<SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> and <SPANCLASS="acronym">BIND</SPAN> if you're juststarting out, let you refine your understanding if you're alreadyfamiliar with them, and provide valuable insight and experience evenif you know 'em like the back of your hand.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-74">Versions</A></H2><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-77"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-80"></A>This book deals with the new 8.1.2 version of <SPANCLASS="acronym">BIND</SPAN>as well as the older 4.9 versions. While 8.1.2 is the most recentversion as of this writing, it hasn't made its way into many vendors'versions of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> yet, partly because 8.1.2 has onlyrecently been released, and many vendors are wary of using such newsoftware.  We will also occasionally mention other versions of<SPANCLASS="acronym">BIND</SPAN>, especially 4.8.3, because many vendorscontinue to ship code based on this older software as part of their<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> products.  Whenever a feature is availableonly in the 4.8.3, 4.9, or 8.1.2 version, or there is a difference inthe behavior of the versions, we try to point out which version doeswhat.</P><PCLASS="para">We use<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-88"></A><KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD>, a name server utility program, a greatdeal in our examples. The version of <KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD> weuse is the one shipped with the 8.1.2 <SPANCLASS="acronym">BIND</SPAN>code. Older versions of <KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD> provide much, butnot quite all, of the functionality in the 8.1.2<KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD>. We have tried to use commands common tomost <KBDCLASS="command">nslookup</KBD>s in our examples; when this was notpossible, we tried to note it.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">&nbsp;</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="DNS &amp; BIND"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf1_02.htm"TITLE="Organization"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: Organization"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">&nbsp;</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">Organization</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
