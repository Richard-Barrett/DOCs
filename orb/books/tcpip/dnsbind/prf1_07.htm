Robert Elz, and Paul Vixie for theirinvaluable contributions to this book. We'd also like to thank ourreviewers, Eric Pearce, Jack Repenning, Andrew Cherenson, Dan Trinkle,Bill LeFebvre, and John Sechrest for their criticism andsuggestions. Without their help, this book would not be what it is(it'd be much shorter!).</P><PCLASS="para">For the second edition, the authors would like to add theirthanks to their sterling review team: Dave Barr, Nigel Campbell, BillLeFebvre, Mike Milligan, and Dan Trinkle.</P><PCLASS="para">For the third edition, the authors salute their technical reviewDream Team: Bob Halley, Barry Margolin and Paul Vixie.</P><PCLASS="para">Cricket would particularly like to thank his former manager,Rick Nordensten, who is the very model of a modern<SPANCLASS="acronym">HP</SPAN> manager, on whose watch the first version ofthis book was written; his neighbors, who bore his occasionalcrabbiness for many months; and of course his wife, Paige, for herunflagging support and for putting up with his tap-tap-tapping duringher nap-nap-napping.  For the second edition, Cricket would like toadd a thank you to his former managers, Regina Kershner and PaulKlouda, for their support of Cricket's work with the Internet. For thethird edition, Cricket acknowledges a debt of gratitude to hispartner, Matt Larson, for his co-development of the Acme Razor.</P><PCLASS="para">Paul would like to thank his wife Katherine for her patience,for many review sessions, and for proving that she could make a quiltin her spare time more quickly than her spouse could write his half ofa book.</P><PCLASS="para">We would also like to thank the folks at O'Reilly &amp;Associates for their hard work and patience. Credit is especially dueour editor, Mike Loukides; our production editor for the secondedition, Nancy Kotary; Ellie Fountain Maden (third edition), RobertRomano (third edition), Steven Abrams; our production copy editor,Kismet McDonough-Chan; our indexers, Seth Maislin (second and thirdeditions) and Ellie Cutler (first edition); our production toolsspecialists, Mike Sierra and Lenny Muellner; and our illustrator,Chris Reilley (second edition). Thanks besides to Jerry Peek, for allsorts of miscellaneous help, and to Tim O'Reilly, for inspiring us toput it all in print.</P><PCLASS="para">And thanks, Edie, for the cricket on the cover!</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf1_06.htm"TITLE="Quotations"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: Quotations"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="DNS &amp; BIND"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="CHAPTER"HREF="ch01_01.htm"TITLE="1.
