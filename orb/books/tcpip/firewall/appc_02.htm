Even other computerprofessionals may not be familiar with all the terms in the networkingalphabet soup. As is always the case, English and computer-speak are notequivalent (or even necessarily compatible) languages. Althoughdescriptions and examples should make the meaning of the networkingjargon more apparent, sometimes terms are ambiguous. A common frame ofreference is necessary for understanding data communicationsterminology.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-C-S2-3">C.2.1 <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN> Reference Model</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="COSI"></A>An architectural model developed by the International StandardsOrganization (<SPANCLASS="acronym">ISO</SPAN>) is frequently used to describethe structure and function of data communications protocols. Thisarchitectural model, called the Open Systems Interconnect(<SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN>) Reference Model, provides a common referencefor discussing communications. The terms defined by this model arewell understood and widely used in the data communicationscommunity&nbsp;- so widely used, in fact, that it is difficult to discussdata communications without using <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN>'sterminology.</P><PCLASS="para">The <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN> Reference Model contains seven<EMCLASS="emphasis">layers</EM> that define the functions of datacommunications protocols. Each layer of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN>model represents a function performed when data is transferred betweencooperating applications across an intervening network. <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appc_02.htm#FIRE-C-FIG-1"TITLE="The OSI Reference Model">Figure 13.5</A> identifies each layer by name and provides ashort functional description for it. Looking at this figure, you cansee that the protocols are like a pile of building blocks stacked oneupon another. Because of this appearance, the structure is oftencalled a <EMCLASS="emphasis">stack</EM> or <EMCLASS="emphasis">protocolstack</EM>.</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-C-FIG-1">Figure 13.5: The <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN> Reference Model</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/firec01.gif"ALT="Figure 13.5"><PCLASS="para">A layer does not define a single protocol; it defines a datacommunications function that may be performed by any number ofprotocols. Therefore, each layer may contain multiple protocols, eachproviding a service suitable to the function of that layer. Forexample, a file transfer protocol and an electronic mail protocol bothprovide user services and both are part of the ApplicationLayer. Every protocol communicates with its peer. A<EMCLASS="emphasis">peer</EM> is an implementation of the same protocol inthe equivalent layer on a remote system (i.e., the local file transferprotocol is the peer of a remote file transfer protocol). Peer levelcommunications must be standardized for successful communications totake place. In the abstract, each protocol is only concerned withcommunicating to its peer; it does not care about the layer above orbelow it.</P><PCLASS="para">However, there must also be agreement on how to pass data between thelayers on a single computer, because every layer is involved in sendingdata from a local application to an equivalent remote application. Theupper layers rely on the lower layers to transfer the data over theunderlying network. Data is passed down the stack from one layer to thenext, until it is transmitted over the network by the Physical Layerprotocols. At the remote end, the data is passed up the stack to thereceiving application. The individual layers do not need to know how thelayers above and below them function; they only need to know how to passdata to them. Isolating network communications functions in differentlayers minimizes the impact of technological change on the entireprotocol suite. New applications can be added without changing thephysical network, and new network hardware can be installed withoutrewriting the application software.</P><PCLASS="para">Although the <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN> model is useful, the<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> protocols don't match its structure exactly.Therefore, in our discussions of <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> we use thelayers of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN> model in the following way:</P><DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Application Layer</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">The Application Layer is the level of the protocol hierarchy whereuser-accessed network processes reside. In this text a<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> application is any network process thatoccurs above the Transport Layer. This includes all of the processesthat users directly interact with, as well as other processes at thislevel that users are not necessarily aware of.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Presentation Layer</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">For cooperating applications to exchange data, they must agree abouthow data is represented.

In<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN>, this function largely occurs in theTransport Layer, and the term &quot;session&quot; is not used. For<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN>, the terms &quot;socket&quot; and &quot;port&quot; are used todescribe the path over which cooperating applications communicate.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Transport Layer</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Much of our discussion of <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> is directed to theprotocols that occur in the Transport Layer. The Transport Layer inthe <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN> reference model guarantees that thereceiver gets the data exactly as it was sent. In<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> this function is performed by theTransmission Control Protocol (<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN>). However,<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> offers a second Transport Layer service,User Datagram Protocol (<SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN>) that does not performthe end-to-end reliability checks.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Network Layer</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">The Network Layer manages connections across the network and isolatesthe upper layer protocols from the details of the underlyingnetwork. The Internet Protocol (<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>), which isolatesthe upper layers from the underlying network and handles theaddressing and delivery of data, is usually described as<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN>'s Network Layer.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Data Link Layer</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">The reliable delivery of data across the underlying physical networkis handled by the Data Link Layer. <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> rarelycreates protocols in the Data Link Layer.
