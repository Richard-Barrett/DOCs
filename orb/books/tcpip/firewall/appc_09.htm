However,the structure of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> address does have someproblems. The <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> designers did not envision theenormous scale of today's network. When <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> wasbeing designed, networking was limited to large organizations thatcould afford substantial computer systems. The idea of a powerful<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> system on every desktop did not exist. At thattime, a 32-bit address seemed so large that it was divided intoclasses to reduce the processing load on routers, even though dividingthe address into classes sharply reduced the number of host addressesactually available for use. For example, assigning a large network asingle class B address, instead of six class C addresses, reduces theload on the router because the router only needs to keep one route forthat entire organization. However, the organization that was given theclass B address probably does not have 64,000 computers, so most ofthe host addresses available to the organization will never beassigned.</P><PCLASS="para">The current address design, which favors routers over growth, is undercritical strain from the rapid growth of the Internet. This is amajor factor in the move from the current <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>version 4 towards <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> version 6 (IPv6).</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-C-S2-9">C.9.2 Subnets</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CSUB"></A>The standard structure of an <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> address can belocally modified by using host address bits as additional networkaddress bits. Essentially, the &quot;dividing line&quot; between network addressbits and host address bits is moved, creating additional networks, butreducing the maximum number of hosts that can belong to each network.These newly designated network bits define a network within the largernetwork, called a subnet.</P><PCLASS="para">Organizations usually decide to subnet in order to overcometopological or organizational problems. Subnetting allowsdecentralized management of host addressing. With the standardaddressing scheme, a single administrator is responsible for managinghost addresses for the entire network. By subnetting, theadministrator can delegate address assignment to smaller organizationswithin the overall organization, which may be a political expedient,if not a technical requirement. If you don't want to deal with thedata processing department, assign them their own subnet and let themmanage it themselves.</P><PCLASS="para">Subnetting can also be used to overcome hardware differences anddistance limitations. <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> routers can linkdissimilar physical networks together, but only if each physicalnetwork has its own unique network address. Subnetting divides asingle network address into many unique subnet addresses, so that eachphysical network can have its own unique address.</P><PCLASS="para">A subnet is defined by applying a bit mask, the <EMCLASS="emphasis">subnetmask</EM>, to the <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> address. If a bit is onin the mask, that equivalent bit in the address is interpreted as anetwork bit. If a bit in the mask is off, the bit belongs to the hostpart of the address. The subnet is only known locally. To the rest ofthe Internet, the address is still interpreted as a standard<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> address.</P><PCLASS="para">For example, the subnet mask that would be associated with standardclass B addresses is 255.255.0.0. The most commonly used subnet maskextends the network portion of a class B address by an additionalbyte. The subnet mask that does this is 255.255.255.0; all bits on inthe first three bytes, and all bits off in the last byte. The firsttwo bytes define the class B network; the third byte defines the thesubnet address; the fourth byte defines the host on that subnet.</P><PCLASS="para">Many network administrators prefer to use byte-oriented masks becausethey are easier to read and understand. However, defining subnet maskson byte boundaries is not a requirement. The subnet mask is bit-orientedand can be applied to any address class. For example, a smallorganization could subdivide a class C address into four subnets withthe mask 255.255.255.192.[5] Applying this mask to a class C addressdefines the two high-order bits of the fourth byte as the subnet part ofthe address. This same mask, applied to a class B address, creates morethan a thousand subnets because ten bits (the full third byte, and twobits of the fourth byte) are used to define the subnets (2^10=1024).</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[5] This is just an illustration.  A mask that creates four subnets is not a good idea because a subnet address of all ones and an address of all zeros are reserved addresses.  Therefore two of the four subnets could not be used.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">As subnets become more and more common, an alternative way of writingsubnet masks is becoming popular: as &quot;/bits&quot; instead of asthe four-octet netmask. For instance, &quot;/24&quot; specifies a24-bit netmask, equivalent to 255.255.255.0, but much faster to write.The new nomenclature makes the assumption that your netmasks are madeup of contiguous bits (i.e., that you never use a netmask of somethinglike 255.0.255.0), but that's standard practice anyway.</P><PCLASS="para">You will also sometimes hear people talk about wildcard masks,particular with respect to Cisco routers and packet filteringspecifications. Wildcard masks are essentially the inverse of subnetmasks; where subnet masks use 1 bit to specify the significant bits(the bits to be looked at), wildcard masks use 1 bit to specify theinsignificant bits (the bits to be ignored). Thus, a subnet mask of255.255.0.0 is equivalent to a wildcard mask of 0.0.255.255, and asubnet mask of 255.255.240.0 is equivalent to a wildcard mask of0.0.15.255.
