It's become so popular thatit no longer requires explanations when mentioned in nontechnicalpublications, and it gets mentioned plenty, in magazines ranging from<EMCLASS="emphasis">The New Yorker</EM> to <EMCLASS="emphasis">Bead andButton</EM>. While nontechnical publications are obsessed withthe Internet, the technical publications have moved on and are obsessedwith security. It's a logical progression; once the first excitement ofhaving a superhighway in your neighborhood wears off, you're bound tonotice that not only does it let you travel, it lets a very large numberof strangers show up where you are, and not all of them are people youwould have invited. </P><PCLASS="para">Both views are true: The Internet is a marvelous technological advancethat provides access to information, and the ability to publishinformation, in revolutionary ways. But it's also a major danger thatprovides the ability to pollute and destroy information in revolutionaryways. This book is about one way to balance the advantages and therisks&nbsp;- to take part in the Internet while still protecting yourself. </P><PCLASS="para">Later in this chapter, we describe different models ofsecurity people have used to protect their data and resources onthe Internet. Our emphasis in this book is on the network securitymodel and, in particular, the use of Internet firewalls. A firewall isa form of protection that allows a network to connect to the Internetwhile maintaining a degree of security. The section later in thischapter called &quot;What is an Internet Firewall?&quot; describes thebasics of firewalls and summarize what they can&nbsp;- and cannot&nbsp;- do tohelp make your site secure. Before we discuss what you can do with afirewall, though, we want to describe briefly why you need one. Whatare you protecting on your systems? What types of attacks and attackersare we seeing today? What types of security can you use to protect yoursite?</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S1-1">1.1 What Are You Trying toProtect?</A></H2><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH01FWWHATTO"></A>A firewall is basically a protective device. If you are building afirewall, the first thing you need to worry about is what you're tryingto protect. When you connect to the Internet, you're putting threethings at risk:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Your data: the information you keep on the computers</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Your resources: the computers themselves</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Your reputation</P></LI></UL></P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S2-1">1.1.1 Your Data</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-224"></A>Your data has three separate characteristics that need to be protected:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Secrecy:</EM> you might not want other people toknow it.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Integrity:</EM> you probably don't want otherpeople to change it.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Availability:</EM> you almost certainly want tobe able to use it yourself.</P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">People tend to focus on the risks associated with secrecy, and it's truethat those are usually large risks. Many organizations have some oftheir most important secrets&nbsp;- the designs for their products, theirfinancial records, or student records&nbsp;- on their computers. On theother hand, you may find that at your site it is relatively easy toseparate the machines containing this kind of highly secret data fromthe machines that connect to the Internet. </P><PCLASS="para">Suppose that you <EMCLASS="emphasis">can</EM> separate your data in thisway, and that none of the information that is Internet accessibleis secret. In that case, why shouldyou worry about security? Because secrecy isn't the only thing you'retrying to protect. You still need to worry about integrity andavailability. After all, if your data isn't secret, and if you don'tmind its being changed, and if you don't care whether or not anybody canget to it, why are you wasting disk space on it?</P><PCLASS="para">Even if your data isn't particularly secret, you'll suffer theconsequences if it's destroyed or modified. Some of these consequenceshave readily calculable costs: if you lose data, you'll have to pay tohave it reconstructed; if you were planning to sell that data in someform, you'll have lost sales regardless of whether the data is somethingyou sell directly, the designs you use to build things from, or the codefor a software product. There are also intangible costs associated withany security incident. The most serious is the loss of confidence (userconfidence, customer confidence, investor confidence, staff confidence,student confidence, public confidence) in your systems and data and,consequently, a loss of confidence in your organization.  </P><DIVCLASS="sidebar"><H4CLASS="sidebar"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-240">Has Your Data Been Modified?</A></H4><PCLASS="para">Security incidents are different from many other types of crimesbecause detection is unusually difficult. Sometimes, it may take along time to find out that someone has broken into yoursite. Sometimes, you'll never know. Even if somebody breaks in butdoesn't actually <EMCLASS="emphasis">do</EM> anything to your system ordata, you'll probably lose time (hours or days) while you verify thatthey didn't do anything.  In a lot of ways, a brute-forcetrash-everything attack is a lot easier to deal with than a break-inby somebody who doesn't appear to damage your system. If they trasheverything, you bite the bullet, restore from backups, and get on withyour life. But, if they don't appear to have done anything, you spenda lot of time second-guessing yourself, trying to make<EMCLASS="emphasis">sure</EM> they haven't done anything to damage yoursystem or data. Although this book is about preventing securityincidents, <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch13_01.htm"TITLE="Responding to Security Incidents">Chapter 13, <CITECLASS="chapter">Responding to Security Incidents</CITE></A> supplies some generalguidelines for detecting, investigating, and recovering from securityincidents.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S2-2">1.1.2 Your Resources</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-249"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-252"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-255"></A>Even if you have data you don't care about&nbsp;- even if youenjoy reinstalling your operating system every week because it exercisesthe disks, or something like that&nbsp;- if other people are going to useyour computers, you probably would like to benefit from this use in someway. Most people want to use their own computers, or they want tocharge other people for using them. Even people who give away computertime and disk space usually expect to get good publicity and thanks forit; they aren't going to get it from intruders. You spend goodtime and money on your computing resources, and it is your right todetermine how they are used. </P><PCLASS="para">Intruders often argue that they are using only excess resources;as a consequence, their intrusions don't cost their victimsanything. There are two problems with this argument. </P><PCLASS="para">First, it's impossible for an intruder to determine successfully whatresources are excess and use only those. It may look as if yoursystem has oceans of empty disk space and hours of unused computingtime; in fact, though, you might be just about to start computing animation sequences that are going to use every bit andevery microsecond. An intruder can't give back your resources when youwant them. (Along the same lines, I don't usually use my car betweenmidnight and 6 <SPANCLASS="acronym">A.M.</SPAN>, but that doesn't mean I'mwilling to lend it to you without being asked. What if I have anearly-morning flight the next day, or what if I'm called out to dealwith an emergency?)</P><PCLASS="para">Second, it's your right to use your resources the way you want to, evenif you merely feel some sort of Zen joy at the sight of empty diskspace, or if you like the way the blinky lights look when nothing'shappening on your computer. Computing resources are not naturalresources, nor are they limited resources that are wasted or destroyedif they're not used. </P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S2-3">1.1.3 Your Reputation</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-264"></A>An intruder appears on the Internet with your identity. Anythinghe does appears to come from you. What are the consequences?</P><PCLASS="para">Most of the time, the consequences are simply that other sites&nbsp;- or lawenforcement agencies&nbsp;- start calling you to ask why you're trying tobreak into their systems. (This isn't as rare an occurrence as it mayseem. One site got serious about security when its systemadministration staff added a line item to their time cards forconversations with the <SPANCLASS="acronym">FBI</SPAN> about break-in attemptsoriginating from their site.)</P><PCLASS="para">Sometimes, such impostors cost you a lot more than lost time. Anintruder who actively dislikes you, or simply takes pleasure in makinglife difficult for strangers, may send electronic mail or post newsmessages that purport to come from you. Generally, people who choose todo this aim for maximum hatefulness, rather than believability, but even if only a few people believe these messages, the cleanup can belong and humiliating. Anything even remotely believable can do permanentdamage to your reputation.</P><PCLASS="para">A few years ago, an impostor posing as a Texas A&amp;M professor sentout hate email containing racist comments to thousands of recipients.The impostor was never found, and the professor is still dealing withthe repercussions of the forged messages. In another case, a student atDartmouth sent out email over the signature of a professor late onenight during exam period. Claiming a family emergency, the forged mailcanceled the next day's exam, and only a few students showed up.</P><PCLASS="para">It's possible to forge electronic mail or news without gaining accessto a site, but it's much easier to show that a message is a forgery ifit's generated from outside the forged site. The messages coming froman intruder who has gained access to your site will look exactly likeyours because they <EMCLASS="emphasis">are </EM>yours. An intruder willalso have access to all kinds of details that an external forgerwon't. For example, an intruder has all of your mailing listsavailable and knows exactly who you send mail to.</P><PCLASS="para">Even if an intruder doesn't use your identity, a break-in at your siteisn't good for your reputation. It shakes people's confidence in yourorganization. In addition, most intruders will attempt to go from yourmachines to others, which is going to make their next victims think ofyour site as a platform for computer criminals. Many intruders will alsouse compromised sites as distribution sites for pirated software and/orpornography, which is not going to endear you to many folks either.Whether or not it's your fault, having your name linked to otherintrusions, software piracy, and pornography is hard to recover from. <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-273"></A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="PART"HREF="part01.htm"TITLE="I.
