What types of attacks are you likelyto face on the Internet, and what types of attackers are likely to becarrying them out? And what about simple accidents or stupidity? Inthe sections below, we touch on these topics but we don't go into anytechnical detail; later chapters describe different kinds of attacksin some detail and explain how firewalls can help protect againstthem.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S2-4">1.2.1 Types of Attacks</A></H3><PCLASS="para">There are many types of attacks on systems, and many ways ofcategorizing these attacks. In this section, we break attacks down intothree basic categories: intrusion, denial of service, and informationtheft.</P><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S3-1">1.2.1.1 Intrusion</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-293"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-296"></A>The most common attacks on your systems are<EMCLASS="emphasis">intrusions</EM>; with intrusions, people are actuallyable to use your computers. Most attackers want to use yourcomputers as if they were legitimate users. </P><PCLASS="para">Attackers have dozens of ways to get access. They range from socialengineering attacks (you figure out the name of somebody high up in thecompany; you call a system administrator, claiming to be that person andclaiming to need your password changed <EMCLASS="emphasis">right now</EM>,so that you can get important work done), to simple guesswork (you tryaccount name and password combinations until one works), to intricateways to get in without needing to know an account name and password. </P><PCLASS="para">As we describe in this book, firewalls help preventintrusions in a number of ways. Ideally, they block all ways toget into a system without knowing an account name andpassword. Properly configured, they reduce the number of accountsaccessible from the outside that are therefore vulnerable to guesswork orsocial engineering.  Most people configure their firewalls to useone-time passwords that prevent guessing attacks. Even if you don'tuse these passwords, which we describe in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch10_01.htm"TITLE="Authentication and Inbound Services">Chapter 10, <CITECLASS="chapter">Authentication and InboundServices</CITE></A>, a firewall will give you a controlled place tolog attempts to get into your system, and, in this way, they helpyou detect guessing attacks.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S3-2">1.2.1.2 Denial of Service</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH01DENOFSERV"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH01EMAILFLOODING"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH01FLOODING"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-314"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-317"></A>A <EMCLASS="emphasis">denial of service</EM> attack is one that's aimedentirely at preventing you from using your own computers.</P><PCLASS="para">In late 1994, writers Josh Quittner and Michelle Slatalla were thetarget of an &quot;electronic mail bomb.&quot; Apparently in retaliation for anarticle on the cracker community they'd published in<EMCLASS="emphasis">Wired</EM> magazine, someone broke into<SPANCLASS="acronym">IBM</SPAN>, Sprint, and the writers' network provider, andmodified programs so their email and telephone service wasdisrupted. A flood of email messages so overwhelmed their networkservice that other messages couldn't get through; eventually, theirInternet connection was shut down entirely. Their phone service alsofell victim to the intruders, who reprogrammed the service so that callerswere routed to an out-of state number where they heard an obscenerecording.</P><PCLASS="para">Although some cases of electronic sabotage involve the actualdestruction or shutting down of equipment or data, more often theyfollow the pattern of flooding seen in the Quittner-Slatalla case orin the case of the Internet worm. An intruder so floods a system ornetwork&nbsp;- with messages, processes, or network requests&nbsp;- that no realwork can be done. The system or network spends all its time respondingto messages and requests, and can't satisfy any of them.</P><PCLASS="para">While flooding is the simplest and most common way to carry out a denialof service attack, a cleverer attacker can also disable services,reroute them, or replace them. For example, the phone attack in theQuittner-Slatalla case denied phone service by rerouting their phonecalls elsewhere; it's possible to mount the same kind of attack againstInternet services. </P><PCLASS="para">It's close to impossible to avoid all denial of service attacks. Sometimes it's a &quot;heads, I win; tails, you lose&quot; situationfor attackers. For example, many sites set accounts up tobecome unusable after a certain number of failed login attempts.This prevents attackers from simply trying passwords until they find theright one. On the other hand, it gives the attackers an easy way tomount a denial of service attack: they lock any user's accountsimply by trying to log in a few times.</P><PCLASS="para">Most often, the risk of denial of service attacks is unavoidable.If you accept things from the externaluniverse&nbsp;- electronic mail, telephone calls, or packages&nbsp;- it's possibleto get flooded. The notorious college prank of ordering a pizza or twofrom every pizzeria in town to be delivered to your least favoriteperson is a form of denial of service; it's hard to do much else whilearguing with 42 pizza deliverers. In the electronic world, denial ofservice is as likely to happen by accident as on purpose (have youever had a persistent fax machine try to fax something to your voiceline?). The most important thing is to set up services so that if oneof them is flooded, the rest of your site keeps functioning while youfind and fix the problem.</P><PCLASS="para">Fortunately, deliberate denial of service attacks are not terriblypopular. They're so easy that they're considered &quot;unsporting&quot; by many attackers; they tend to be simple totrace back and are therefore risky to the attacker; and they don't providethe attacker with the information or the ability to use your computers(the payoff for most other attacks). Intentional denial of serviceattacks are the work of people who are angry at your site in particular,and at most sites such people are quite rare. </P><PCLASS="para">You are far more likely to encounter unintentional denial of serviceproblems, as we discuss in the section on &quot;Stupidity andAccidents&quot; later in this chapter.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-330"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-331"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-332"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S3-3">1.2.1.3 Information Theft</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH01INFOTHEFT"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-338"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-341"></A>Some types of attacks allow an attacker to get data without ever havingto directly use your computers. Usually these attacks exploit Internetservices that are intended to give out information, inducing theservices to give out more information than was intended, or to give itout to the wrong people. ManyInternet services are designed for use on local area networks, anddon't have the type or degree of security that would allow them to beused safely across the Internet.</P><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Information theft </EM>doesn't need to be active orparticularly technical. People who want to find out personalinformation could simply call you and ask (perhapspretending to be somebody who had a right to know): this is an activeinformation theft. Or they could tap your telephone: a passiveinformation theft. Similarly, people who want to gather electronicinformation could actively query for it (perhaps pretending to be amachine or a user with valid access) or could passively tap thenetwork and wait for it to flow by.</P><PCLASS="para">Most people who steal information try to get access toyour computers; they're looking for usernames and passwords. Fortunatelyfor them, and unfortunately for everybody else, that's the easiest kindof information to get when tapping a network. Username and passwordinformation occurs quite predictably at the beginning of many networkinteractions, and such information can be reused in the sameform. </P><PCLASS="para">How would you proceed if you want to find out how somebody answers hertelephone?  Installing a tap would be an easy and reliable way to getthat information, and a tap at a central point in the telephone systemwould yield you the telephone greetings of hundreds or thousands ofpeople in a short period of time.</P><PCLASS="para">On the other hand, what if you want to know how somebody spells his lastname, or what the names and ages of his children are? In this case,a telephone tap is a slow and unreliable way to get that information. Atelephone tap at a central point in the system will probablyyield that information about some people, and it will certainlyyield some secret information you could use in interestingways, but the information is going to be buried among the conversationsof hundreds of people setting up lunch dates and chatting about theweather.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-351"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-354"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-357"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-360"></A>Similarly, network taps, which are usually called<EMCLASS="emphasis">sniffers</EM>, are very effective at finding passwordinformation, but are rarely used to gather other kinds of information.Getting more specific information about a site requires either extremededication and patience, or the knowledge that the information youwant will reliably pass through a given place at a given time. Forexample, if you know that somebody calls his bank to transfer moneybetween his checking and savings accounts at 2 <SPANCLASS="acronym">P.M.</SPAN>every other Friday, it's worth tapping that phone call to find out theperson's access codes and account numbers. However, it's probably notworth tapping somebody else's phone, on the off chance that they toowill do such a transfer, because most people don't transfer money overthe phone at all.</P><PCLASS="para">Network sniffing is much easier than tapping a telephone line.Traditionally, the connectors used to hook a computer up to a networkare known as <EMCLASS="emphasis">network taps</EM> (that's why the term<EMCLASS="emphasis">tapping</EM> isn't used for spying on a network), andthe connectors behave like taps too. In most common networktechnologies, such as Ethernet and token ring, any computer on a localarea network is capable of seeing all the traffic that passes acrossthat local area network. Traffic that crosses the Internet may cross anynumber of local area networks, any one of which can be a point ofcompromise. Network service providers and public-access systems are verypopular targets for intrusions; sniffers placed there can be extremelysuccessful because so much traffic passes through these networks.</P><PCLASS="para">There are several types of protection against information theft. Aproperly configured firewall will protect you against people who aretrying to get more information than you intended to give.Once you've decided to give information out across the Internet,however, it's very difficult to protect against that informationreaching an unintended audience, either through misauthentication(somebody claiming to be authorized, when they're not) or throughsniffing (somebody simply reading information as it crosses a correctlyauthorized channel). Although these risks are outside of the protectiona firewall can give (because they occur once information hasintentionally been allowed to go outside your network), we do discussthem, and the methods used to reduce them, as appropriate in this book.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-369"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-370"></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S2-5">1.2.2 Types of Attackers</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH01INTRUDTYPES"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-377"></A>This section very briefly describes the types of attackers who are outthere on the Internet. There are many ways to categorize theseattackers; we can't really do justice to the many variants of attackerswe've seen over the years, and any quick summary of this kindnecessarily presents a rather stereotyped view. Nevertheless, thissummary may be useful in distinguishing the main categories ofattackers.</P><PCLASS="para">All attackers share certain characteristics. They don't want to becaught, so they try to conceal themselves. If they gainaccess to your system, they will certainly attempt to preserve thataccess, if possible, by building in extra ways to get access (andthey hope you won't notice these access routes even if you find theattackers themselves). Most of them have some contact with other peoplewho have the same kinds of interests (&quot;the underground&quot; isnot hard to find), and most will share the information they get fromattacking your system.</P><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S3-4">1.2.2.1 Joyriders</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-384"></A><EMCLASS="emphasis">Joyriders </EM>are bored people looking foramusement. They break in because they think you might have interestingdata, or because it would be amusing to use your computers, or becausethey have nothing better to do. They might be out to learnabout the kind of computer you have or about the data youhave. They're curious, but not actively malicious; however, they oftendamage the system through ignorance or in trying to cover their tracks.Joyriders are particularly attracted to well-known sites and uncommoncomputers. </P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S3-5">1.2.2.2 Vandals</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-390"></A><EMCLASS="emphasis">Vandals</EM> are out to do damage, either because theyget their kicks from destroying things, or because they don't likeyou. When one gets to you, you'll know it.</P><PCLASS="para">Vandals are a big problem if you're somebody that the Internetunderground might think of as The Enemy (for example, the phone companyor the government) or if you tend to annoy people who have computers andtime (for example, you're a university with failing students, or acomputer company with annoyed customers, or you have an aggressivelycommercial presence on the Internet). You can also become a targetsimply by being large and visible; if you put a big white wall up in certain neighborhoods, people will put graffiti on it no matter how they feelabout you. </P><PCLASS="para">Fortunately, vandals are fairly rare. People don't like them, evenpeople in the underground who have nothing against breaking intocomputers in general. Vandals also tend to inspire people to go to greatlengths to find them and stop them. Unlike more mundane intruders,vandals have short but splashy careers. Most of them also go forstraightforward destruction, which is unpleasant but is relativelyeasily detected and repaired. In most circumstances, deleting your data,or even ruining your computer equipment, is not the worst thing somebodycould do to you, but it is what vandals do. (Actually, introducingsubtle but significant changes in programs or financial data would bemuch harder to detect and fix.)</P><PCLASS="para">Unfortunately, it's close to impossible to stop a determined vandal;somebody with a true vendetta against your site is going to get you,sooner or later. Certain attacks are attractive to vandals but not to othertypes of attackers. For example, denial of service attacks are notattractive to joyriders; while joyriders are around in your system, theyare just as interested as you are in having your computers up, running,and available to the Internet. </P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S3-6">1.2.2.3 Score Keepers</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-399"></A>Many intruders are engaging in an updated version of an ancienttradition. They're gaining bragging rights, based on the number andtypes of systems they've broken into. </P><PCLASS="para">Like joyriders and vandals, <EMCLASS="emphasis">score keepers</EM> mayprefer sites of particular interest. Breaking into something well-known,well-defended, or otherwise especially neat is usually worth more pointsto them. However, they'll also attack anything they can get at; they'regoing for quantity as well as quality. They don't have to want anythingyou've got, or care in the least about the characteristics of your site.They may or may not do damage on the way through. They'll certainlygather information and keep it for later use (perhaps using it to barterwith other attackers). They'll probably try to leave themselves ways toget back in later. And, if at all possible, they'll use your machines asa platform to attack others. </P><PCLASS="para">These people are the ones you discover long after they've broken in toyour system. You may find out slowly, because something's odd about yourmachine. Or you'll find out when another site or a law enforcementagency calls up because your system is being used to attack otherplaces. Or you'll find out when somebody sends you a copy of your ownprivate data, which they've found on a cracked system on the other sideof the world.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S3-7">1.2.2.4 Spies (Industrial andOtherwise)</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-407"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-409"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-411"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-414"></A>Most people who break into computers do so for the same reason peopleclimb mountains&nbsp;- because they're there. While these people are notabove theft, they usually steal things that are directly convertible intomoney or further access (e.g., credit card, telephone, or networkaccess information). If they find secrets they think they can sell, theymay try to do so, but that's not their main business. </P><PCLASS="para">As far as anybody knows, serious computer-based espionage is much rarer,outside of traditional espionage circles. (That is, if you're aprofessional spy, there are probably other professional spies watchingyou and your computers). Espionage is much more difficult to detectthan run-of-the-mill break-ins, however. Information theft need notleave any traces at all, and even intrusions are relatively rarelydetected immediately. Somebody who breaks in, copies data, and leaveswithout disturbing anything is quite likely get away with it at mostsites.</P><PCLASS="para">In practical terms, most organizations can't prevent spies fromsucceeding. The precautions that governments take to protect sensitiveinformation on computers are complex, expensive, and cumbersome;therefore they are used on only the most critical resources. Theseprecautions include electromagnetic shielding, careful access controls, andabsolutely no connections to unsecured networks.</P><PCLASS="para">What can you do to protect against attackers of this kind? You canensure that your Internet connection isn't the easiest way for a spy togather information. You don't want some kid to break into your computersand find something that immediately appears to be worth trying to sellto spies; you don't want your competitors to be trivially able to get toyour data; and you do want to make it expensive and risky to spy on you.Some people say it's unreasonable to protect data from network accesswhen somebody could get it easily by coming to your site physically. Wedon't agree; physical access is generally more expensive and morerisky for an attacker than network access.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S2-6">1.2.3 Stupidity and Accidents</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-424"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-426"></A>Most disasters are not caused through ill will; they're accidents orstupid mistakes. One recent study estimates that 55% of all securityincidents actually result from naive or untrained users doing thingsthey shouldn't.[1]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] Richard Power, <CITECLASS="citetitle">Current and Future Danger: A<SPANCLASS="acronym">CSI</SPAN> Primer on Computer Crime and InformationWarfare</CITE>, San Francisco, CA: Computer Security Institute,1995.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-434"></A>Denial of service incidents, for example, frequently aren't attacks atall. Apple's corporate electronic mail was rendered nonfunctional forseveral days (and their network provider was severely inconvenienced) byan accident involving a single mail message sent from a buggy mailserver to a large mailing list. The mail resulted in a cascade ofhundreds of thousands of error messages. The only hostile personinvolved was the system administrator, who wasn't hostile untilhe had to clean up the resulting mess.</P><PCLASS="para">Similarly, it's not uncommon for companies to destroy their own data, orrelease it to the world, by accident. Firewalls aren't designed to dealwith this kind of problem. In fact there is no known way to protectyourself from either accidents or stupidity. Unfortunately, whetherpeople are attacking you on purpose, or are simply making mistakes, theresults are quite similar. (Hence the saying, &quot;Never ascribe tomalice that which can adequately be explained by stupidity.&quot;) When you protect yourself against evil-doers, you also help protectyourself against the more common, but equally devastating, unintentionalor well-intentioned error.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-438"></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_01.htm"TITLE="1.1 What Are You Trying to Protect?"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 1.1 What Are You Trying to Protect?"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_03.htm"TITLE="1.3 How Can You Protect Your Site?"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 1.3 How Can You Protect Your Site?"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">1.1 What Are You Trying to Protect?</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">1.3 How Can You Protect Your Site?</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
