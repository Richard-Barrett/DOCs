People choose a variety of securitymodels, or approaches, ranging from no security at all, through what'scalled &quot;security through obscurity&quot; and host security, tonetwork security.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S3-8">1.3.1 No Security</A></H3><PCLASS="para">The simplest possible approach is to put no effort at all into security,and run with whatever minimal security your vendor provides you bydefault. If you're reading this book, you've probably already rejectedthis model.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S3-9">1.3.2 Security Through Obscurity</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-451"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-454"></A>Another possible security model is the one commonly referred to as&quot;security through obscurity.&quot; With this model, a system ispresumed to be secure simply because (supposedly) nobody knowsabout it&nbsp;- its existence, contents, security measures, or anythingelse. This approach seldom works for long; there are just too many waysto find an attractive target. </P><PCLASS="para">Many people assume that even though attackers can find them, theywon't bother to. They figure that a small company or a home machinejust isn't going to be of interest to intruders. In fact, manyintruders aren't aiming at particular targets; they just want to breakinto as many machines as possible. To them, small companies and homemachines simply look like easy targets. They probably won't stay long,but they will attempt to break in, and they may do considerable damageif they do get in while they try to cover their tracks.</P><PCLASS="para">To function on any network, the Internet included, a site has to do atleast a minimal amount of registration, and much of this registrationinformation is available to anyone, just for the asking. Every time asite uses services on the network, someone&nbsp;- at the very least, whoeveris providing the service&nbsp;- will know they're there. Intruders watch fornew connections, in the hope that these sites won't yet have securitymeasures in place. Some sites have reported automated probes apparentlybased on new site registrations.</P><PCLASS="para">You'd probably be amazed at how many different ways someone candetermine security-sensitive information about your site. For example,knowing what hardware and software you have and what version of theoperating system you're running gives intruders important clues aboutwhat security holes they might try. They can often get this informationfrom your host registration, or by trying to connect to your computer.Many computers disclose their type of operating system in the greetingyou get before you log in, so an intruder doesn't need access to get it. </P><PCLASS="para">Intruders have a lot of time on their hands, and can often avoid havingto figure out obscure facts by simply trying all the possibilities. Inthe long run, relying on obscurity is not a smart security choice.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S3-10">1.3.3 Host Security</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-464"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-467"></A>Probably the most common model for computer security is host security. With this model, you enforce the security of each host machineseparately, and you make every effort to avoid or alleviate all theknown security problems that might affect that particular host. What'swrong with host security? It's not that it doesn't work on individualmachines; it's that it doesn't scale to large numbers of machines. </P><PCLASS="para">The major impediment to effective host security in modern computingenvironments is the complexity and diversity of those environments. Most modern environments include machines from multiple vendors, eachwith its own operating system, and each with its own set of securityproblems. Even if the site has machines from only one vendor, differentreleases of the same operating system often have significantly differentsecurity problems. Even if all these machines are from a single vendorand run a single release of the operating system, differentconfigurations (different services enabled, and so on) can bringdifferent subsystems into play (and into conflict) and lead to differentsets of security problems. And, even if the machines are all absolutelyidentical, the sheer number of them at some sites can make securing themall difficult. It takes a significant amount of up-front and ongoingwork to effectively implement and maintain host security. Even with allthat work done correctly, host security still often fails due to bugs invendor software, or due to a lack of suitably secure software for somerequired functions.</P><PCLASS="para">Host security also relies on the good intentions and the skill ofeveryone who has privileged access to any machine. As the number ofmachines increases, the number of privileged users generally increasesas well. Securing a machine is much more difficult than attaching it toa network, so insecure machines may appear on your network as unexpectedsurprises. The mere fact that it is not supposed to be possible to buyor connect machines without consulting you is immaterial; people developtruly innovative purchasing and network-connection schemes if they feelthe need.</P><PCLASS="para">A host security model may be highly appropriate for small sites, orsites with extreme security requirements. Indeed, all sites shouldinclude some level of host security in their overall security plans.Even if you adopt a network security model, as we describe in the nextsection, certain systems in your configuration will benefit from thestrongest host security. For example, even if you have built afirewall around your internal network and systems, there will becertain systems exposed to the outside world that need hostsecurity. (We discuss this in detail in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch05_01.htm"TITLE="Bastion Hosts">Chapter 5, <CITECLASS="chapter">Bastion Hosts</CITE></A>.)The problem is, the host security model alone just isn'tcost-effective for any but small or simple sites; making it workrequires too many restrictions and too many people.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S3-11">1.3.4 Network Security</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-477"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-481"></A>As environments grow larger and more diverse, and as securing them on ahost-by-host basis grows more difficult, more sites are turningto a network security model. With a network security model, youconcentrate on controlling network access to your various hosts and theservices they offer, rather than on securing them one by one.  Networksecurity approaches include building firewalls to protect your internalsystems and networks, using strong authentication approaches (such asone-time passwords), and using encryption to protect particularlysensitive data as it transits the network.</P><PCLASS="para">A site can get tremendous leverage from its security efforts by using anetwork security model. For example, a single network firewall of thetype we discuss in this book can protect hundreds, thousands, or eventens of thousands of machines against attack from networks beyond thefirewall, regardless of the level of host security of the individualmachines.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="note"><PCLASS="para"><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Although this book concentrates on network security, please notethat we aren't suggesting you ignore host security. As mentioned above, you should apply the strongest possible host securitymeasures to your most important machines, especially to those machinesthat are directly connected to the Internet. You'll also want toconsider using host security on your internal machines in general, toaddress security problems other than attacks from the Internet.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-01-S2-7">1.3.5 No Security Model Can Do ItAll</A></H3><PCLASS="para">No security model can solve all your problems. No securitymodel&nbsp;- short of &quot;maximum security prison&quot;&nbsp;- can prevent ahostile person with legitimate access from purposefully damaging yoursite or taking confidential information out of it. To get aroundpowerful host and network security measures, a legitimate user cansimply use physical methods. These may range from pouring soda intoyour computers to carrying sensitive memos home. You can protectyourself from accidents and ignorance internally, and from maliciousexternal acts, but you cannot protect yourself from your legitimateusers without severely damaging their ability to use theircomputers. Spies succeed in breaching government security withdepressing regularity despite regulations and precautions well beyondthe resources and tolerance of civilians.</P><PCLASS="para">No security model can take care of management problems; computersecurity will not keep your people from wasting time, annoying eachother, or embarrassing you. Sites often get sucked into trying to makesecurity protect against these things. When people are wasting timereading Usenet news, annoying each other by playing tricks with windowsystems, and embarrassing the company with horrible email, computersecurity looks like a promising technological solution that avoidsdifficult issues. Unfortunately, a security model won't work here. Itis expensive and difficult to even try to solve these problems withcomputer security, and you are once again in the impossible situationof trying to protect yourself from legitimate users.</P><PCLASS="para">No security model provides perfect protection. You can expect to makebreak-ins rare, brief, and inexpensive, but you can't expect to avoidthem altogether. Even the most secure and dedicated sites expect to havea security incident every few years.[2] </P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[2] You can impress a security expert by saying you've only been broken intoonce in the last five years; if you say you've never been broken into,they stop being impressed and decide that either you can't detectbreak-ins, or you haven't been around long enough for anyone to tryseriously! </P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Why bother, then? Security may not prevent every single incident, butit can keep an incident from seriously damaging or even shutting downyour business. At one high-profile company with multiple computerfacilities, a manager complained that his computer facility wassupposed to be the most secure, but it got broken into along withseveral others.  The difference was that the break-in was the firstone that year for his facility; the intruder was present for onlyeight minutes; and the computer facility was off the Internet for only12 hours (from 6 <SPANCLASS="acronym">P.M.</SPAN> to 6<SPANCLASS="acronym">A.M.</SPAN>), after which it resumed business as usualwith no visible interruption in service to the company'scustomers. For one of the other facilities, it was the fourth time;the intruder was present for months before being detected; recoveryrequired taking the facility down for four days; and they had toinform customers that they had shipped them tapes containing possiblycontaminated software. Proper security made the difference between anannoying occurrence and a devastating one.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_02.htm"TITLE="1.2 What Are You Trying To Protect Against?"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 1.2 What Are You Trying To Protect Against?"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_04.htm"TITLE="1.4 What Is an Internet Firewall?"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 1.4 What Is an Internet Firewall?"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">1.2 What Are You Trying To Protect Against?</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">1.4 What Is an Internet Firewall?</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
