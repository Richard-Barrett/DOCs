Newsgroups arethe Internet counterpart to bulletin boards, and are designed formany-to-many communication. Mailing lists also support many-to-manycommunication, but much less openly and efficiently, because there's noeasy way to find out about all mailing lists, and every recipient hashis own copy of every message. The largest discussion mailing lists(i.e., lists where discussions take place among subscribers, rather thanlists used to simply distribute information or announcements tosubscribers) have tens of thousands of subscribers; the most popularnewsgroups have hundreds of thousands. Usenet news is rather liketelevision: there's a lot going on; most of it has little sociallyredeeming value; some of it is fantastically amusing or informative; andeverybody wants it. </P><PCLASS="para">The risks of news are much like those of electronic mail: your usersmight foolishly trust information received; they might releaseconfidential information; and you might get flooded. News resembles aflood when it's functioning normally&nbsp;- most sites receivehundreds of megabytes a day, and the amount increases steadily, doublingin volume approximately every six months&nbsp;- so you must makeabsolutely sure to configure news so that floods don't affect otherservices. Because news is rarely an essential service, denial ofservice attacks on a single site are usually just ignored. The securityrisks of news are therefore quite low. You might want to avoid newsbecause you don't have the bandwidth or the disk space to spare, but it'snot a significant security problem. </P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-880"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-882"></A>Network News Transfer Protocol (<SPANCLASS="acronym">NNTP</SPAN>) is used totransfer news across the Internet. In setting up the news server atyour site, you'll need to determine the most secure way for news toflow into your internal systems so <SPANCLASS="acronym">NNTP</SPAN> can't beused to penetrate your system. Some sites put the news server on thebastion host, others on an internal system, as we'll describe in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A>. <SPANCLASS="acronym">NNTP</SPAN> doesn't do much, andyour external transfers of news will all be with specific othermachines (it's not like mail, which you want to receive fromeverybody), so it's not particularly difficult to secure.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-890"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-893"></A>The biggest security issue you'll face with news is what to do withprivate newsgroups. Many sites create private local newsgroups tofacilitate discussions among their users; these private newsgroupsoften contain sensitive, confidential, or proprietaryinformation. Someone who can access your <SPANCLASS="acronym">NNTP</SPAN>server can potentially access these private newsgroups, resulting indisclosure of this information. If you're going to create privatenewsgroups, be sure to configure <SPANCLASS="acronym">NNTP</SPAN> carefully tocontrol access to these groups. (The configuring of<SPANCLASS="acronym">NNTP</SPAN> to work in a firewall environment is discussedmore fully in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A>.)</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_03.htm"TITLE="2.3 Remote Terminal Access and Command Execution"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 2.3 Remote Terminal Access and Command Execution"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_05.htm"TITLE="2.5 The World Wide Web"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 2.5 The World Wide Web"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.3 Remote Terminal Access and Command Execution</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.5 The World Wide Web</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
