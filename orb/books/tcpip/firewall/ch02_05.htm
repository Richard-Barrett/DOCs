The World Wide Web (<SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN>) is a new,entirely Internet-based concept, based in part on existing services,and in part on a new protocol, HyperText Transfer Protocol(<SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN>).</P><PCLASS="para">Many people confuse the functions and origins of<SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN>, Mosaic, and <SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN>, and theterminology used to refer to these three distinct entities has becomemuddy. Some of the muddiness was introduced intentionally; Webbrowsers attempt to provide a seamless interface to a wide variety ofinformation through a wide variety of mechanisms, and blurring thedistinctions makes it easier to use, if more difficult to comprehend.Here is a quick summary of what the individual entities are about.</P><PCLASS="para">The <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN> is the collection of<SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN> servers (see the description of<SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN> below) on the Internet. The Web isresponsible, in large part, for the recent explosion in Internetactivity. <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN> is based on concepts developed at theEuropean Particle Physics Laboratory (<SPANCLASS="acronym">CERN</SPAN>) inGeneva, Switzerland, by Tim Berners-Lee and others. Much of thegroundbreaking work on Web clients was done at the National Center forSupercomputing Applications (<SPANCLASS="acronym">NCSA</SPAN>) at theUniversity of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. There are manyorganizations and individuals developing Web client and serversoftware these days, and many more using these technologies for a hugerange of purposes. Nobody &quot;controls&quot; the Web, however,much as nobody &quot;controls&quot; the Internet.</P><PCLASS="para">The Web uses hypertext technology to link together a web of documents,which may include text, graphics images, sound files, video files, andother formats. The documents can be traversed in any way&nbsp;- not onlyhierarchically&nbsp;- to search for information. Hypertext provides thenavigation from one document to another on the Internet. Users can movefreely from one to another, regardless of where the documents arelocated, by simply clicking on a word or picture for which an<SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN> link has been defined. </P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-926"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-928"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-931"></A><SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN> is the primary applicationprotocol that underlies the World Wide Web: it provides users accessto the files that make up the Web. As mentioned above, these filesmight be in many different formats (text, graphics, audio, video,etc.), but the most common format on the Web is the HyperText MarkupLanguage (<SPANCLASS="acronym">HTML</SPAN>). <SPANCLASS="acronym">HTML</SPAN> is astandardized page description language for creating Web pages. Itprovides basic document-formatting capabilities (including the abilityto include graphics), and allows you to specify hypertext links toother servers and files.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-938"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-940"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-942"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-944"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-946"></A>Mosaic, developed by Marc Andreessen and others at<SPANCLASS="acronym">NCSA</SPAN>, is an <SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN> client, whichis used as a browser of the Web. <SPANCLASS="acronym">NCSA</SPAN> Mosaic isfree and runs on Windows, the Macintosh, and many different flavors of<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>. There are many other web browsers availableand as this book goes to press, the most popular is NetscapeNavigator, a commercial product that is available free for nonprofitand educational use or for commercial evaluation. It also runs onWindows, the Macintosh, and various <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>machines. (Other Web browsers include Lynx,Viola<SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN>, perl<SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN>, andMidas<SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN>.) <SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN> is but oneprotocol spoken by Mosaic; Mosaic clients typically also speak atleast the <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN>, Gopher, and <SPANCLASS="acronym">WAIS</SPAN>protocols. Netscape Navigator speaks all of those and also<SPANCLASS="acronym">NNTP</SPAN> and <SPANCLASS="acronym">SMTP</SPAN>. Thus, when userssay &quot;we want Mosaic&quot; or &quot;we want Netscape,&quot;what they really mean, from a protocol level, is that they want accessto the <SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN> servers that make up the<SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN>, as well as the associated Gopher,<SPANCLASS="acronym">WAIS</SPAN>, and <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN> servers (plus, forNetscape, <SPANCLASS="acronym">NNTP</SPAN> and <SPANCLASS="acronym">SMTP</SPAN>servers).</P><PCLASS="para">Web browsers are fantastically popular, and for good reason. Theyprovide a rich, graphical interface to an immense number of Internetresources. Information and services that were unavailable or expert-onlybefore are now easily accessible. In Silicon Valley, you can use the Webto have dinner delivered without leaving your computer except to answerthe door. It's hard to get a feel for the Web without experiencing it;it covers the full range of everything you can do with a computer, fromthe mundane to the sublime with a major side trip into the ridiculous. </P><PCLASS="para">Unfortunately, Web browsers and servers are hard to secure. Theusefulness of the Web is in large part based on its flexibility, butthat flexibility makes control difficult. Just as it's easier totransfer and execute the right program from a Web browser than fromFTP, it's easier to transfer and execute a malicious one. Web browsersdepend on external programs, generically called &quot;viewers&quot;(even if they play sounds instead of showing pictures), to deal withdata types that the browsers themselves don't understand. (Thebrowsers generally understand basic data types such as<SPANCLASS="acronym">HTML</SPAN>, plain text, and <SPANCLASS="acronym">JPEG</SPAN> and<SPANCLASS="acronym">GIF</SPAN> graphics.) You should be very careful aboutwhich viewers you configure by default; you don't want a viewer thatcan do dangerous things because it's going to be running on yourcomputers, as if it were one of your users, taking commands from anexternal source. You also want to warn users not to add viewers, orchange viewer configurations, based on advice from strangers.</P><PCLASS="para">Because an <SPANCLASS="acronym">HTML</SPAN> document can easily link todocuments on other servers, it's easy for people to become confusedabout exactly who is responsible for a given document. New users maynot notice when they go from internal documents at your site toexternal ones. This has two unfortunate consequences. First, they maytrust external documents inappropriately (because they think they'reinternal documents.) Second, they may blame the internal Webmaintainers for the sins of the world. People who understand the Webtend to find this hard to believe, but it's a commonmisconception: the dark side of having a very smooth transitionbetween sites.</P><PCLASS="para">Most Web servers are reasonably secure, as shipped. However, they canalso call external programs. These programs are relatively easy towrite, but very difficult to secure. You should treat server-sideextensions with the same caution you would treat a new server of anykind.</P><PCLASS="para">(We discuss the security of Web clients and servers in more detail in<ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A>.)<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-978"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_04.htm"TITLE="2.4 Usenet News"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 2.4 Usenet News"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_06.htm"TITLE="2.6 Other Information Services"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 2.6 Other Information Services"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.4 Usenet News</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.6 Other Information Services</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
