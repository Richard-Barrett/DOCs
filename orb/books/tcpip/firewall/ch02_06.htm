Each item can be a file, a form, or anadditional menu, with its own items. There are a number of differentGopher clients available, including free, shareware, and commercialclients for Windows, Macintosh, and <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>. Gopherclients and servers use an extensible data scheme, much as Web clientsand servers do, and are thus subject to many of the same securityconcerns.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-993"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-995"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-998"></A>Wide Area Information Service (<SPANCLASS="acronym">WAIS</SPAN>) was developedby a consortium of companies: Thinking Machines, Apple, Dow Jones, and<SPANCLASS="acronym">KPMG</SPAN> Peat Marwick; the development was led byBrewster Kahle. A <SPANCLASS="acronym">WAIS</SPAN> user submits a simple query(typically a keyword or a phrase), and the <SPANCLASS="acronym">WAIS</SPAN>server sends back a list of the documents containing those words,along with a score for each document. This score is a composite of thenumber of times the keywords are mentioned and the length of thedocument; shorter documents get higher scores, as do documents thatmention the keywords more often. The list of documents is returnedsorted by score, so that with any luck the most relevant documentsappear first in the list. The server maintains extensive indexes ofthe contents of all the documents on the server to allow it to dothese searches efficiently. There are currently several hundred<SPANCLASS="acronym">WAIS</SPAN> servers on the Internet. You can access themwith <SPANCLASS="acronym">WAIS</SPAN>-protocol clients, or by using a Webbrowser to access one of the sites that provides<SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP-WAIS</SPAN> gateways (e.g.,<ACLASS="systemitem.url"HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/the-net/wais.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/the-net/wais.html</A>).</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1009"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1011"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1014"></A>Archie is an Internet service that searches indexes of anonymous FTPservers for file and directory names. Archie servers typically provideservice via Telnet and email in addition to dedicated Archie clients.Archie service providers generally prefer that users use dedicatedArchie clients, because they impose less of a load on the server.Archie is also accessible through Web browsers via sites that provide<SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN>-Archie gateways, such as the one at<ACLASS="systemitem.url"HREF="http://www.nexor.co.uk/archie.html">http://www.nexor.co.uk/archie.html</A>. At thispoint, there are only about 20 Archie servers throughout the world,partly because of the significant resources (computing power, diskspace, network bandwidth, and administrator time) required to run anArchie server, and partly because each Archie server searches much ofthe Internet for <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN>'able files on a regularbasis. If there were a large number of Archie servers, so muchbandwidth would be consumed looking for resources that it would beimpossible to use the resources.</P><PCLASS="para"><SPANCLASS="acronym">WAIS</SPAN> and Archie are less open to mischief than<SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN> and Gopher, because they don't return data ofarbitrary types. If a <SPANCLASS="acronym">WAIS</SPAN> server advises you thata document is about gardening, and it turns out to be aboutmanufacturing jewelry in your spare time, this may be annoying, butit's not a problem for the security of your computers. Unfortunately,providing access to some of these services may open other securityholes unrelated to the service itself. For example, allowing yourusers to access Archie directly may allow attackers to access your<SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN> and <SPANCLASS="acronym">NIS/YP</SPAN> servers, as wediscuss in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A>.</P><PCLASS="para">Running servers is somewhat riskier. Unlike the clients, the serversfor these protocols&nbsp;- including <SPANCLASS="acronym">WAIS</SPAN> andArchie&nbsp;- accept arbitrary queries, and you must be sure that theyaren't going to produce unexpected results. Any server that acts onrequests from potentially hostile users is vulnerable to denial ofservice attacks and to executing unexpected commands on the servermachine with the permissions of the server program.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_05.htm"TITLE="2.5 The World Wide Web"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 2.5 The World Wide Web"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_07.htm"TITLE="2.7 Information About People "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 2.7 Information About People "BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.5 The World Wide Web</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.7 Information About People </TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
