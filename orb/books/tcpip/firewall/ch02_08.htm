All of these servicesprovide a way for people to interact with other people, as opposed towith databases or information archives. Electronic mail and Usenet newsare designed to facilitate asynchronous communications; they work evenif the participants aren't currently logged in. The next time they login, the email messages or news postings will be waiting forthem. Real-time conferencing services, on the other hand, are designedfor interactive use by on-line participants.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1083"></A><EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> is the oldest real-time conferencing systemused on the Internet. It is available on most<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> machines and allows two people to hold aconversation. A user initiates a <EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> session byissuing the command &quot;talk other-user@host&quot;,specifying the other user's address in basically the same way as theiremail address. The other user gets a message on his screen that says&quot;so-and-so is requesting a talk session&quot; and explaininghow to answer. When the contacted user answers (the equivalent ofpicking up the phone when someone calls you),<EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> finishes establishing the connection betweenthe caller and the contacted user; both users see a split screen,where what they type appears in the top half of the screen, and whatthe other user types appears in the bottom half.</P><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> is not widely used between strangers on theInternet, although it is often used between colleagues or friends atdifferent sites (or even different parts of the same building). Somepeople find it convenient, useful, or enjoyable to keep a window openwith a <EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> session to a colleague (or a friend)while they work; it's less intrusive than a phone call, and allows youto convey textual information&nbsp;- commands to be run, output fromcommands cut-and-pasted for the other user to see, etc.&nbsp;- moreconveniently than over the phone. There aren't really any networksecurity implications for <EMCLASS="emphasis">talk </EM>itself; the onlyissue is that it can be very tricky to allow across a firewall withoutunintentionally opening other security holes, as we describe in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A>.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1095"></A>Internet Relay Chat (<SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN>) is sort of like CitizensBand (<SPANCLASS="acronym">CB</SPAN>) radio on the Internet; it has its own littleculture involving lots of people talking at each other. Users access<SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> via dedicated <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> clients,or by using Telnet to access a site that provides public<SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> client service. <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> serversprovide hundreds (sometimes thousands) of named &quot;channels&quot;for users to join. These channels come and go (anyone can create a newchannel, and a channel survives as long as there's anyone on it),although some popular channels are more or less permanent. Unlike<EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM>, which is limited to a pair of users, anynumber of people can participate on an <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> channelsimultaneously. Some <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> clients allow a user toparticipate in multiple channels simultaneously (sort of like takingpart in two different conversations at once at a party).</P><PCLASS="para">There are a number of security problems with <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN>;most of the problems aren't with the protocol itself, but with theclients, and with who uses <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> and how. Many of theclients allow servers far more access to local resources (files,processes, programs, etc.) than is wise; a malicious server can wreakhavoc with a weak client. Further, many of the most frequent users of<SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> are pranksters and crackers who use<SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> to pass technical information among themselves,and to try to trick other <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> users. Their idea ofa fine time is to tell some neophyte <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> user&quot;Hey, give this command to your <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> client sothat I can show you this neat new toy I wrote.&quot; Then, when theunsuspecting user follows the prankster's directions, the commandstrash the system. Anyone using <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> needs a goodclient program and a healthy dose of wariness and suspicion.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1116"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1118"></A>The Multicast Backbone (<SPANCLASS="acronym">MBONE</SPAN>) is the source of anew set of services on the Internet, focusing on expanding real-timeconference services beyond text-based services like<EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> and <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> to include audio,video, and electronic whiteboard. The <SPANCLASS="acronym">MBONE</SPAN> isstill in its infancy, but it is already used to send real-time videoof many technical conferences and programs over the Internet, e.g., InternetEngineering Task Force meetings, keynote sessions from<SPANCLASS="acronym">USENIX</SPAN> conferences, space shuttle flightoperations, and so on. At this point, the commonlyused <SPANCLASS="acronym">MBONE</SPAN> services appear to be reasonably secure.Unintentional denial of service can be a real concern with the<SPANCLASS="acronym">MBONE</SPAN>, however, because audio and video use so much memory. The methods used to distribute <SPANCLASS="acronym">MBONE</SPAN>across the Internet also present some interesting risks, which arediscussed in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A>.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1130"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1131"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_07.htm"TITLE="2.7 Information About People "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 2.7 Information About People "BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_09.htm"TITLE="2.9 Name Service"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 2.9 Name Service"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.7 Information About People </TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.9 Name Service</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
