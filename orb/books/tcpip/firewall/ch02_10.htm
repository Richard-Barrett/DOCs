Bothare named after the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> programs that were thefirst implementations, but both are now available in some form onalmost all Internet-capable platforms. They do not have their ownprotocols, but make use of the same underlying protocol, the InternetControl Message Protocol (<SPANCLASS="acronym">ICMP</SPAN>). Unlike most ofthe programs we've discussed, they are not clients of distinguishableservers. <SPANCLASS="acronym">ICMP</SPAN> is implemented at a low level as arequired part of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> protocols allInternet hosts use.</P><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis">ping</EM> simply tests reachability; it tells youwhether or not you can get a packet to and from a given host, andoften additional information like how long it took the packet to makethe round trip. <EMCLASS="emphasis">traceroute</EM> tells you not onlywhether you can reach a given host (and whether it can answer), butalso the route your packets take to get to that host; this isvery useful in analyzing and debugging network trouble somewherebetween you and some destination.</P><PCLASS="para">Because there aren't servers for <EMCLASS="emphasis">ping</EM> and<EMCLASS="emphasis">traceroute</EM>, you can't simply decide not to turnthe servers on. It's possible to use packet filtering to prevent thepackets from being transmitted from your site or received at yoursite, but it's usually not necessary. There are no known risks foroutbound <EMCLASS="emphasis">ping</EM> or <EMCLASS="emphasis">traceroute</EM>,and very few for inbound <EMCLASS="emphasis">ping </EM> and<EMCLASS="emphasis">traceroute. </EM>They can be used for denial ofservice attacks, but no more so than other protocols. Morethreateningly, they can be used to determine which hosts at your siteexist, as a preliminary step to attacking them. For this reason, manysites either prevent or limit the relevant packets inbound.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1222"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1224"></A>Simple Network Management Protocol (<SPANCLASS="acronym">SNMP</SPAN>) is aprotocol designed to make it easy to centrally manage networkequipment (routers, bridges, concentrators, hubs, and, to a certainextent, even hosts). <SPANCLASS="acronym">SNMP</SPAN> management stations canrequest information (whether a given interface is up ordown, how many bytes have been moved through that interface, how manyerrors there have been on that interface, etc.) from network equipmentvia <SPANCLASS="acronym">SNMP</SPAN>. <SPANCLASS="acronym">SNMP</SPAN> managementstations can also control certain functions of the network equipment(taking an interface up or down, setting its parameters, and soon). The network equipment can also report urgent information (forexample, that a line has gone down, or that there are a significantnumber of errors occurring on a given line) to <SPANCLASS="acronym">SNMP</SPAN>management stations via <SPANCLASS="acronym">SNMP</SPAN>. The major securityrisk with <SPANCLASS="acronym">SNMP</SPAN> is that someone else might be ableto take over control of your network equipment and reconfigure it fortheir purposes (disabling packet filtering, changing routing, orsimply trashing your configuration).</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_09.htm"TITLE="2.9 Name Service"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 2.9 Name Service"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_11.htm"TITLE="2.11 Time Service "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 2.11 Time Service "BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.9 Name Service</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.11 Time Service </TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
