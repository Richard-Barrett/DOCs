There are probably manyexamples of choke points in your life: the toll booth on a bridge, thecheck-out line at the supermarket, the ticket booth at a movie theatre.</P><PCLASS="para">In network security, the firewall between your site and the Internet(assuming that it's the only connection between your site and theInternet) is such a choke point; anyone who's going to attack your sitefrom the Internet is going to have to come through that channel, whichshould be defended against such attacks. You should be watchingcarefully for such attacks and be prepared to respond if you see them.</P><PCLASS="para">A choke point is useless if there's an effective way for an attacker togo around it. Why bother attacking the fortified front door if thekitchen door around back is wide open? Similarly, from a networksecurity point of view, why bother attacking the firewall if there aredozens or hundreds of unsecured dial-up lines that could be attacked more easily and probably more successfully? </P><PCLASS="para">A second Internet connection&nbsp;- even an indirect one, like a connectionto another company which has its own Internet connection elsewhere&nbsp;- isan even more threatening breach. Internet-based attackers might nothave a modem available, or might not have gotten around to acquiringphone service they don't need to pay for, but they can certainly findeven roundabout Internet connections to your site.</P><PCLASS="para">A choke point may seem to be putting all your eggs in one basket, andtherefore a bad idea, but the key is that it's a basket youcan guard carefully. The alternative is to split your attentionamong many different possible avenues of attack. If you split yourattention in this way, chances are that you won't be able to do anadequate job of defending any of the avenues of attack, or that someonewill slip through one while you're busy defending another (where theymay even have staged a diversion specifically to draw your attentionaway from their real attack).</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch03_02.htm"TITLE="3.2 Defense in Depth"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 3.2 Defense in Depth"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch03_04.htm"TITLE="3.4 Weakest Link"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 3.4 Weakest Link"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">3.2 Defense in Depth</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">3.4 Weakest Link</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
