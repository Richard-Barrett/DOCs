If someone can simplyopt out of your security mechanisms, then an attacker may be able toattack you by first attacking that exempt person's system and thenattacking your site from the inside. For example, the best firewallin the world won't protect you if someone who sees it as anunreasonable burden sets up a back-door connection between your siteand the Internet in order to circumvent the firewall. This can be aseasy as buying a modem, obtaining free <SPANCLASS="acronym">PPP</SPAN> or<SPANCLASS="acronym">SLIP</SPAN> software off the Internet, and paying a fewdollars a month to a local low-end Internet service provider; this iswell within the price range and technical abilities of many users andmanagers.</P><PCLASS="para">Much more mundane forms of rebellion will still ruin your security. Youneed everybody to report strange happenings that might besecurity-related; you can't see everything. You need people to choosegood passwords; to change them regularly; and not to give them out totheir friends, relatives, and pets. </P><PCLASS="para">How do you get everyone to participate? Participation might bevoluntary (you convince everybody that it's a good idea) or involuntary(someone with appropriate authority and power tells them to cooperate orelse), or some combination of the two. Obviously, voluntaryparticipation is strongly preferable to involuntary participation; youwant folks helping you, not looking for ways to get around you. Thismeans that you may have to work as an evangelist within yourorganization, selling folks on the benefits of security and convincingthem that the benefits outweigh the costs.</P><PCLASS="para">People who are not voluntary participants will go to amazing lengths tocircumvent security measures. On one voicemail system that requiredpasswords to be changed every month, numerous people discovered that itrecorded only six old passwords, and took to changing their passwordsseven times in a row (in seven separate phone calls!) in order to beable to use the same password. This sort of behavior leads to an armsrace (the programmers limit the number of times you can change yourpassword), and soon numerous people are sucked into a purely internalbattle. You have better things to do with your time, as do your users;it's worth spending a lot of energy to convince people to cooperatevoluntarily, because you'll often spend just as much to force them,with worse side effects.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch03_05.htm"TITLE="3.5 Fail-Safe Stance"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 3.5 Fail-Safe Stance"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch03_07.htm"TITLE="3.7 Diversity of Defense"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 3.7 Diversity of Defense"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">3.5 Fail-Safe Stance</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">3.7 Diversity of Defense</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
