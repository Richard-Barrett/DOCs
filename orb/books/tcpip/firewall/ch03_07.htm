If all of your systems are the same, somebody who knows how tobreak into one of them probably knows how to break into all of them.</P><PCLASS="para">The idea behind <EMCLASS="emphasis">diversity of defense</EM> is thatusing security systems from different vendors may reduce the chancesof a common bug or configuration error that compromises themall. There is a tradeoff in terms of complexity and cost,however. Procuring and installing multiple different systems is goingto be more difficult, take longer, and be more expensive thanprocuring and installing a single system (or even several identicalsystems). You're going to have to buy the multiple systems (at reduceddiscounts from each vendor, because you're buying less from them) andmultiple support contracts to cover them. It's also going to takeadditional time and effort for your staff to learn how to deal withthese different systems.</P><PCLASS="para">Beware of illusionary diversity. Simply using different vendors'<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> systems probably won't buy you diversity,because most <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> systems are derived from eitherthe <SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN> or System V source code. Further, mostcommon <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> networking applications (such asSendmail, <EMCLASS="emphasis">telnet/telnetd</EM>,<EMCLASS="emphasis">ftp/ftpd</EM>, and so on), are derived from the<SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN> sources, regardless of whether they're on a<SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN>- or System V-based platform. There were anynumber of bugs and security problems in the original releases thatwere propagated into most of the various vendor-specific versions ofthese operating systems; many vendor-specific versions of<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> still have bugs and security problems thatwere first discovered years ago in other versions from other vendors,and have not yet been fixed.</P><PCLASS="para">Also beware that diverse systems configured by the same person (orgroup of people) may share common problems if the problems stem fromconceptual rather than technological roots. If the problem is amisunderstanding about how a particular protocol works, for example,your diverse systems may all be configured incorrectly in the same wayaccording to that misunderstanding.</P><PCLASS="para">Although many sites acknowledge that using multiple types of systemscould potentially increase their security, they often conclude thatdiversity of defense is more trouble than it's worth, and that thepotential gains and security improvements aren't worth the costs. Wedon't dispute this; each site needs to make its own evaluation anddecision concerning this issue.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch03_06.htm"TITLE="3.6 Universal Participation"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 3.6 Universal Participation"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch03_08.htm"TITLE="3.8 Simplicity"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 3.8 Simplicity"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">3.6 Universal Participation</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">3.8 Simplicity</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
