Such a host could act as a router between thenetworks these interfaces are attached to; it is capable of routing<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> packets from one network to another. However, toimplement a dual-homed host type of firewalls architecture, youdisable this routing function. Thus, <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> packetsfrom one network (e.g., the Internet) are not directly routed to theother network (e.g., the internal, protected network). Systems insidethe firewall can communicate with the dual-homed host, and systemsoutside the firewall (on the Internet) can communicate with thedual-homed host, but these systems can't communicate directly witheach other. <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> traffic between them is completelyblocked.</P><PCLASS="para">The network architecture for a dual-homed host firewall is prettysimple: the dual homed host sits between, and is connected to, theInternet and the internal network. <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch04_02.htm#FIRE-04-FIG-3"TITLE="Dual-homed host architecture">Figure 4.3</A>shows this architecture.</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-FIG-3">Figure 4.3: Dual-homed host architecture</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire0403.gif"ALT="Figure 4.3"><PCLASS="para">Dual-homed hosts can provide a very high level of control. If youaren't allowing packets to go between external and internal networksat all, you can be sure that any packet on the internal network thathas an external source is evidence of some kind of securityproblem. In some cases, a dual-homed host will allow you to rejectconnections that claim to be for a particular service but that don'tactually contain the right kind of data. (A packet filtering system, onthe other hand, hasdifficulty with this level of control.) However, it takes considerablework to consistently take advantage of the potential advantages ofdual-homed hosts.</P><PCLASS="para">A dual-homed host can only provide services by proxying them, or byhaving users log into the dual-homed host directly. As we discuss in<ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch05_01.htm"TITLE="Bastion Hosts">Chapter 5, <CITECLASS="chapter">Bastion Hosts</CITE></A>, user accounts present significant securityproblems by themselves. They present special problems on dual-homedhosts, where they may unexpectedly enable services you considerinsecure. Furthermore, most users find it inconvenient to use adual-homed host by logging into it. </P><PCLASS="para">Proxying is much less problematic, but may not be available for allservices you're interested in. <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch07_01.htm"TITLE="Proxy Systems">Chapter 7</A> discussessome workarounds for this situation, but they do not apply in everycase. The screened subnet architecture we describe in the next sectionoffers some extra options for providing new and/or untrustedservices (e.g., you can add to the screened subnet a worthless machinethat provides only an untrusted service).<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1879"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1880"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-S2-5">4.2.2 Screened Host Architecture</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH04HOSTAS"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH04SHA"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH04PACKFILT2"></A>Whereas a dual-homed host architecture provides services from a hostthat's attached to multiple networks (but has routing turned off), a<EMCLASS="emphasis">screened host architecture</EM> provides services from ahost that's attached to only the internal network, using a separaterouter. In this architecture, the primary security is provided by packetfiltering.

Eventhen, only certain types of connections are allowed. Any externalsystem trying to access internal systems or services will have toconnect to this host. The bastion host thus needs to maintain a highlevel of host security.</P><PCLASS="para">The packet filtering also permits the bastion host to open allowableconnections (what is &quot;allowable&quot; will be determined byyour site's particular security policy) to the outside world. Thesection about bastion hosts in the discussion of the screened subnetarchitecture later in this chapter, contains more information aboutthe functions of bastion hosts, and <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch05_01.htm"TITLE="Bastion Hosts">Chapter 5</A>describes in detail how to build one.</P><PCLASS="para">The packet filtering configuration in the screening router may do one ofthe following:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Allow other internal hosts to open connections to hosts on theInternet for certain services (allowing those services via packetfiltering, as discussed in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch06_01.htm"TITLE="Packet Filtering">Chapter 6</A>),</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Disallow all connections from internal hosts (forcingthose hosts to use proxy services via the bastion host, as discussed in<ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch07_01.htm"TITLE="Proxy Systems">Chapter 7</A>).</P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">You can mix and match these approaches for different services; somemay be allowed directly via packet filtering, while others may beallowed only indirectly via proxy. It all depends on the particularpolicy your site is trying to enforce.</P><PCLASS="para">Because this architecture allows packets to move from the Internet tothe internal networks, it may seem more risky than a dual-homed hostarchitecture, which is designed so that no external packet can reach the internal network. In practice, however, the dual-homed hostarchitecture is also prone to failures that let packets actually crossfrom the external network to the internal network. (Because thistype of failure is completely unexpected, there are unlikely to beprotections against attacks of this kind.) Furthermore, it's easier todefend a router, which provides a very limited set of services, than itis to defend a host. For most purposes, the screened host architectureprovides both better security and better usability than the dual-homedhost architecture. </P><PCLASS="para">Compared to other architectures, however, such as the screened subnetarchitecture discussed in the following section, there are somedisadvantages to the screened host architecture. The major one is thatif an attacker manages to break in to the bastion host, there is nothingleft in the way of network security between the bastion host and therest of the internal hosts. The router also presents a single point offailure; if the router is compromised, the entire network is availableto an attacker. For this reason, the screened subnet architecture hasbecome increasingly popular.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1913"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1914"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1915"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-S2-6">4.2.3 Screened Subnet Architecture</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH04SSA"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH04SUBSA"></A>The <EMCLASS="emphasis">screened subnet architecture</EM> adds an extralayer of security to the screened host architecture by adding aperimeter network that further isolates the internal network from theInternet. </P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH04BASTHOSTISO"></A>Why do this? By their nature, bastion hosts are the most vulnerablemachines on your network. Despite your best efforts to protect them,they are the machines most likely to be attacked, because they're themachines that <EMCLASS="emphasis">can be</EM> attacked. If, as in a screenedhost architecture, your internal network is wide open to attack fromyour bastion host, then your bastion host is a very tempting target. There are no other defenses between it and your other internal machines(besides whatever host security they may have, which is usually verylittle). If someone successfully breaks into the bastion host in ascreened host architecture, he's hit the jackpot.</P><PCLASS="para">By isolating the bastion host on a perimeter network, you can reduce theimpact of a break-in on the bastion host. It is no longer aninstantaneous jackpot; it gives an intruder some access, but not all.</P><PCLASS="para">With the simplest type of screened subnet architecture, there are twoscreening routers, each connected to the perimeter net. One sitsbetween the perimeter net and the internal network, and the other sitsbetween the perimeter net and the external network (usually theInternet). To break into the internal network with this type ofarchitecture, an attacker would have to get past <EMCLASS="emphasis">both </EM>routers. Even if the attacker somehow broke in to the bastionhost, he'd still have to get past the interior router. There is nosingle vulnerable point that will compromise the internal network.</P><PCLASS="para">Some sites go so far as to create a layered series of perimeter netsbetween the outside world and their interior network. Less trusted andmore vulnerable services are placed on the outer perimeter nets,fathest from the interior network. The idea is that an attacker whobreaks into a machine on an outer perimeter net will have a hardertime successfully attacking internal machines because of theadditional layers of security between the outer perimeter and theinternal network. This is only true if there is actually some meaningto the different layers, however; if the filtering systems betweeneach layer allow the same things between all layers, theadditional layers don't provide any additional security.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch04_02.htm#FIRE-04-FIG-5"TITLE="Screened subnet architecture (using two routers)">Figure 4.5</A> shows a possible firewall configurationthat uses the screened subnet architecture.

If an attacker successfully breaks into the outer reaches ofyour firewall, the perimeter net offers an additional layer ofprotection between that attacker and your internal systems.</P><PCLASS="para">Here's an example of why a perimeter network can be helpful. In manynetwork setups,  it's possible for any machine on a given network tosee the traffic for every machine on that network. This is true formost Ethernet-based networks, (and Ethernet is by far the most commonlocal area networking technology in use today); it is also true forseveral other popular technologies, such as token ring and<SPANCLASS="acronym">FDDI</SPAN>. Snoopers may succeed in picking up passwordsby watching for those used during Telnet, <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN>,and <EMCLASS="emphasis">rlogin</EM> sessions. Even if passwords aren'tcompromised, snoopers can still peek at the contents of sensitive files people may be accessing, interesting email theymay be reading, and so on; the snooper can essentially &quot;watch overthe shoulder&quot; of anyone using the network.</P><PCLASS="para">With a perimeter network, if someone breaks into a bastion host on theperimeter net, he'll be able to snoop only on traffic on that net. Allthe traffic on the perimeter net should be either to or from thebastion host, or to or from the Internet. Because no strictly internaltraffic (that is, traffic between two internal hosts, which ispresumably sensitive or proprietary) passes over the perimeter net,internal traffic will be safe from prying eyes if the bastion host iscompromised.</P><PCLASS="para">Obviously, traffic to and from the bastion host, or the external world,will still be visible. Part of the work in designing a firewall isensuring that this traffic is not itself confidential enough thatreading it will compromise your site as a whole.

It allows selected services outbound from the internal net to the Internet. These services are the services your site can safely support and safely provide using packet filtering rather than proxies.

In practice, exterior routers tend to allow almost anythingoutbound from the perimeter net, and they generally do very littlepacket filtering.  The packet filtering rules to protect internalmachines would need to be essentially the same on both the interiorrouter and the exterior router; if there's an error in the rules thatallows access to an attacker, the error will probably be present onboth routers.</P><PCLASS="para">Frequently, the exterior router is provided by an external group (forexample, your Internet provider), and your access to it may belimited.  An external group that's maintaining a router will probablybe willing to put in a few general packet filtering rules, but won'twant to maintain a complicated or frequently changing rule set. Youalso may not trust them as much as you trust your own routers. If therouter breaks and they install a new one, are they going to rememberto reinstall the filters? Are they even going to bother to mentionthat they replaced the router so that you know to check?</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2028"></A>The only packet filtering rules that are really special on theexterior router are those that protect the machines on the perimeternet (that is, the bastion hosts and the internalrouter). Generally, however, not much protection is necessary, becausethe hosts on the perimeter net are protected primarily through hostsecurity (although redundancy never hurts).</P><PCLASS="para">The rest of the rules that you could put on the exterior router areduplicates of the rules on the interior router. These are the rulesthat prevent insecure traffic from going between internal hosts andthe Internet. To support proxy services, where the interior routerwill let the internal hosts send some protocols as long as they aretalking <EMCLASS="emphasis">to</EM> the bastion host, the exterior routercould let those protocols through as long as they are coming<EMCLASS="emphasis">from</EM> the bastion host. These rules are desirablefor an extra level of security, but they're theoretically blockingonly packets that can't exist because they've already been blocked bythe interior router. If they do exist, either the interior router hasfailed, or somebody has connected an unexpected host to the perimeternetwork.</P><PCLASS="para">So, what does the exterior router actually need to do? One of thesecurity tasks that the exterior router <EMCLASS="emphasis">can</EM>usefully perform&nbsp;- a task that usually can't easily be done anywhereelse&nbsp;- is the blocking of any incoming packets from the Internet thathave forged source addresses. Such packets claim to have come fromwithin the internal network, but actually are coming in from theInternet.</P><PCLASS="para">The interior router could do this, but it can't tell if packets thatclaim to be from the perimeter net are forged. While the perimeter netshouldn't have anything fully trusted on it, it's still going to bemore trusted than the external universe; being able to forge packetsfrom it will give an attacker most of the benefits of compromising thebastion host. The exterior router is at a clearer boundary. Theinterior router also can't protect the systems on the perimeter netagainst forged packets.
