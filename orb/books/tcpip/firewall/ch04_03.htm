However, there is a lot of variation inarchitectures.  There is a good deal of flexibility in how you canconfigure and combine firewall components to best suit your hardware,your budget, and your security policy. This section describes somecommon variations, and their benefits and drawbacks.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-S2-7">4.3.1 It's <SPANCLASS="acronym">OK</SPAN> to UseMultiple Bastion Hosts</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH04FWBASTHOSTMULT"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH04BASTHOST2"></A>Although we tend to talk about a single bastion host in this book, itmay make sense to use multiple bastion hosts in your firewallconfiguration, as we show in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch04_03.htm#FIRE-04-FIG-6"TITLE="Architecture using two bastion hosts">Figure 4.6</A>. Reasonsyou might want to do this include performance, redundancy, and theneed to separate data or servers.</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-FIG-6">Figure 4.6: Architecture using two bastion hosts</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire0406.gif"ALT="Figure 4.6"><PCLASS="para">You might decide to have one bastion host handle the services that areimportant to your own users (such as <SPANCLASS="acronym">SMTP</SPAN> servers,proxy servers, and so on), while another host handles the servicesthat you provide to the Internet, but which your users don't careabout (for example, an anonymous <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN> server). Inthis way, performance for your own users won't be dragged down by theactivities of outside users.</P><PCLASS="para">You may have performance reasons to create multiple bastion hosts evenif you don't provide services to the Internet. Some services, likeUsenet news, are resource-intensive and easilyseparated from others.  It's also possible to provide multiple bastionhosts with the same services for performance reasons, but it can bedifficult to do load balancing. Most services need to be configuredfor particular servers, so creating multiple hosts for individualservices works best if you can predict usage in advance.</P><PCLASS="para">How about redundancy? If your firewall configuration includes multiplebastion hosts, you might configure them for redundancy, so that if onefails, the services can be provided by another, but beware that onlysome services support this approach. For example, you might configureand designate multiple bastion hosts as <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> serversfor your domain (via <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS NS</SPAN> [NameServer] records, which specify the name servers for a domain), or as<SPANCLASS="acronym">SMTP</SPAN> servers (via <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS MX</SPAN> [Mail Exchange] records, which specify what servers willaccept mail for a given host or domain), or both. Then, if one of thebastion hosts is unavailable or overloaded, the <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN>and <SPANCLASS="acronym">SMTP</SPAN> activity will use the other as a fallbacksystem.</P><PCLASS="para">You might also use multiple bastion hosts to keep the data sets ofservices from interfering with each other. In addition to theperformance issues discussed earlier, there may be security reasonsfor this separation. For example, you might decide toprovide one <SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN> server for use by your customersover the Internet, and another for use by the general public. Byproviding two servers, you can offer different data to customers andpossibly better performance, by using a less loaded or more powerfulmachine.</P><PCLASS="para">You could also run your <SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN> server andyour anonymous <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN> server on separate machines, toeliminate the possibility that one server could be used to compromisethe other. (For a discussion of of how this might be done, see thedescription of <SPANCLASS="acronym">HTTP</SPAN> server vulnerabilities in<ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A>.)<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2080"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2081"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-S2-8">4.3.2 It's <SPANCLASS="acronym">OK</SPAN> to Merge the Interior Router and the Exterior Router</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2086"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2089"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2091"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2094"></A>You can merge the interior and exterior routers into a single router, but only if you have a router sufficiently capable and flexible.  In general, you need a router that allows you to specify both inbound and outbound filters on each interface. In <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch06_01.htm"TITLE="Packet Filtering">Chapter 6</A>, we discuss what this means, and we describe the packet filtering problems that may arise with routers that have more than two interfaces and don't have this capability.</P><PCLASS="para">If you merge the interior and exterior routers, as we show in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch04_03.htm#FIRE-04-FIG-7"TITLE="Architecture using a merged interior and exterior router">Figure 4.7</A>, you'll still have a perimeter net (on oneinterface of the router) and a connection to your internal net (onanother interface of the router). Some traffic would flow directlybetween the internal net and the Internet (the traffic that is permittedby the packet filtering rules set up for the router), and other trafficwould flow between the perimeter net and the Internet, or the perimeternet and the internal net (the traffic that is handled by proxies).</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-FIG-7">Figure 4.7: Architecture using a merged interior and exterior router</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire0407.gif"ALT="Figure 4.7"><PCLASS="para">This architecture, like the screened host architecture, makes the sitevulnerable to the compromise of a single router.

Here's an example:suppose you only have a dial-up <SPANCLASS="acronym">SLIP</SPAN> or<SPANCLASS="acronym">PPP</SPAN> connection to the Internet.  In this case, youmight run something like the Morning Star <SPANCLASS="acronym">PPP</SPAN>package on your bastion host, and let it act as both bastion host andexterior router. This is functionally equivalent to the three-machineconfiguration (bastion host, interior router, exterior router)described for the screened subnet architecture shown earlier inthis chapter.</P><PCLASS="para">Using a dual-homed host to route traffic won't give you theperformance or the flexibility of a dedicated router, but you don'tneed much of either for a single low-bandwidth connection. Dependingon the operating system and software you're using, you may or may nothave the ability to do packet filtering. Several of the availableinterface software packages, such as the Morning Star<SPANCLASS="acronym">PPP</SPAN> package mentioned earlier, have quite goodpacket filtering capabilities. However, because the exterior routerdoesn't have to do much packet filtering anyway, using an interfacepackage that doesn't have good packet filtering capabilities is notthat big a problem.</P><PCLASS="para">Unlike merging the interior and exterior routers, merging the bastionhost with the exterior router, as shown in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch04_03.htm#FIRE-04-FIG-8"TITLE="Architecture using a merged bastion host and exterior router">Figure 4.8</A>, does not open significant new vulnerabilities.It does expose the bastion host further. In this architecture, thebastion host is more exposed to the Internet, protected only by whateverfiltering (if any) its own interface package does, and you will need totake extra care to protect it. </P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-FIG-8">Figure 4.8: Architecture using a merged bastion host and exterior router</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire0408.gif"ALT="Figure 4.8"></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-S2-10">4.3.4 It's Dangerous to Merge  the BastionHost and the Interior Router</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2127"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2130"></A>While it is acceptable to merge the bastion host and the exteriorrouter, as we discussed in the previous section, it's not a good ideato merge the bastion host and the interior router, as we show in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch04_03.htm#FIRE-04-FIG-9"TITLE="Architecture using a merged bastion host and interior router">Figure 4.9</A>. Doing so compromises your overall security.</P><PCLASS="para">The bastion host and the exterior router each perform distinctprotective tasks; they complement each other but don't back eachother up. The interior router functions in part as a backup to the twoof them.</P><PCLASS="para">If you merge the bastion host and the interior router, you've changedthe firewall configuration in a fundamental way. In the first case(with a separate bastion host and interior router), you have ascreened subnet firewall architecture. With this type ofconfiguration, the perimeter net for the bastion host doesn't carryany strictly internal traffic, so this traffic is protected fromsnooping even if the bastion host is successfully penetrated; to getat the internal network, the attacker still must get past the interiorrouter. In the second case (with a merged bastion host and interiorrouter), you have a screened host firewall architecture. With thistype of configuration, if the bastion host is broken into, there'snothing left in the way of security between the bastion host and theinternal network.</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-FIG-9">Figure 4.9: Architecture using a merged bastion host and interior router</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire0409.gif"ALT="Figure 4.9"><PCLASS="para">One of the main purposes of the perimeter network is to prevent thebastion host from being able to snoop on internal traffic.

If you're lucky, this approach simply won't work,because it will be blocked by the packet filtering on one of therouters. If you're unlucky, it will work, and you'll have sensitive,strictly internal traffic flowing across your perimeter net, where itcan be snooped on if somebody has managed to break in to the bastionhost.</P><PCLASS="para">It's also difficult to keep multiple interior routers correctlyconfigured. The interior router is the one with the most important andthe most complex set of packet filters and having two of them doublesyour chances of getting the rule sets wrong.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2149"></A>Nevertheless, you may still end up wanting to do this. On a largeinternal network, having a single interior router may be both aperformance problem and a reliability problem. If you're trying toprovide redundancy, that single point of failure is a major annoyance.In that case, the safest (and most redundant) thing to do is to set upeach interior router to a separate perimeter net and exterior router;this configuration is discussed later in this chapter. Thisconfiguration is more complex and more expensive, but it increases bothredundancy and performance, as well as making it highly unlikely thattraffic will try to go between the interior routers (if the Internet isthe shortest route between two parts of your internal network, you havemuch worse problems than most sites) and extraordinarily unlikely thatit will succeed (four sets of packet filters are trying to keep it out).</P><PCLASS="para">If performance problems alone are motivating you to look at multipleinterior routers, it's hard to justify the expense of separate perimeternetworks and exterior routers. In most cases, however, the interiorrouter is not the performance bottleneck. If it is, then one of thefollowing cases is occurring:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">There is a lot of traffic going to the perimeter net that is not thengoing to the external network.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Your exterior gateway is much faster than your interior gateway. </P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">In the first case, you have misconfigured something; the perimeter netmay take occasional traffic that isn't destined for the external worldin some configurations (for example, <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> queriesabout external hosts when the information is cached), but that trafficshould never be significant. In the second case, you should seriouslyconsider upgrading the interior router to match the exterior router,instead of adding a second one.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch04_03.htm#FIRE-04-FIG-10"TITLE="Architecture using multiple interior routers">Figure 4.10</A> shows the basic architecture usingmultiple interior routers.</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-FIG-10">Figure 4.10: Architecture using multiple interior routers</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire0410.gif"ALT="Figure 4.10"><PCLASS="para">Another reason for having multiple interior routers is that you havemultiple internal networks, which have technical, organizational, orpolitical reasons not to share a single router. The simplest way toaccommodate these networks would be to give them separate interfaceson a single router, as shown in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch04_03.htm#FIRE-04-FIG-11"TITLE="Multiple internal networks (separate interfaces in a single router)">Figure 4.11</A>. Thiscomplicates the router configuration considerably (how considerablydepends a great deal on the router in question, as discussed in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch06_01.htm"TITLE="Packet Filtering">Chapter 6</A>), but doesn't produce the risks of a multipleinterior router configuration. If there are too many networks for asingle router, or if sharing a router is unpalatable for otherreasons, consider making an internal backbone and connecting it to theperimeter network with a single router, as shown in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch04_03.htm#FIRE-04-FIG-12"TITLE="Multiple internal networks (backbone architecture)">Figure 4.12</A>.</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-FIG-11">Figure 4.11: Multiple internal networks (separate interfaces in a singlerouter)</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire0411.gif"ALT="Figure 4.11"><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-FIG-12">Figure 4.12: Multiple internal networks (backbone architecture)</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire0412.gif"ALT="Figure 4.12"><PCLASS="para">You may find that an effective way to accommodate different securitypolicies among different internal networks is to attach them to theperimeter through separate routers, (e.g., one network wants toallow connections that others consider insecure.) In this case, theperimeter network should be the <EMCLASS="emphasis">only</EM>interconnection between the internal networks; there should be noconfidential traffic passing between them; and each internal networkshould treat the other as an untrusted, external network. Thisis likely to be extremely inconvenient for some users on each network,but anything else will either compromise the security of the site as awhole or remove the distinction that caused you to set up the tworouters in the first place.</P><PCLASS="para">If you decide that you are willing to accept the risks of havingmultiple interior routers, you can minimize those risks by having allthe interior routers managed by the same group (so conflictingsecurity policies aren't being enforced).
