There are a number of reasons why youmight want to do this:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">You have test or lab networks with strange things going onthere.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">You have networks that are less secure than the rest ofyour site, e.g., demonstration or teaching networks whereoutsiders are commonly present.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">You have networks that are more secure than the rest ofyour site, e.g., secret development projects or networks wherefinancial data or grades are passed around.</P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">This is another situation where firewalls are a useful technology. Insome cases, you will want to build <EMCLASS="emphasis">internalfirewalls</EM>; that is, firewalls that sit between two parts ofthe same organization, or between two separate organizations that sharea network, rather than between a single organization and the Internet. </P><PCLASS="para">It often makes sense to keep one part of your organization separate fromanother. Not everyone in an organization needs the same services orinformation, and security is frequently more important in someparts of an organization (the accounting department, for example) thanin others.</P><PCLASS="para">Many of the same tools and techniques you use to build Internetfirewalls are also useful for building these internal firewalls. However, there are some special considerations that you will need tokeep in mind if you are building an internal firewall.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-S2-15">4.4.1 Laboratory Networks</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2266"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2268"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2271"></A>Laboratory and test networks are often the first networks that peopleconsider separating from the rest of an organization via a firewall(usually as the result of some horrible experience where somethingescapes the laboratory and runs amok). Unless people are working onrouters, this type of firewall can be quite simple. Neither aperimeter net nor a bastion host is needed, because there is no worryabout snooping (all users are internal anyway), and you don't need toprovide many services (the machines are not people's homemachines). In most cases, you'll want a packet filtering router thatallows any connection inbound to the test network, but only known safeconnections from it. (What's safe will depend on what the test networkis playing with, rather than on the normal security considerations.)</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2274"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2277"></A>In a few cases (for example, if you are testing bandwidth on thenetwork), you may want to protect the test network from outside trafficthat would invalidate tests, in which case you'll deny inboundconnections and allow outbound connections.</P><PCLASS="para">If you are testing routers, it's probably wisest to use an entirelydisconnected network; if you don't do this, then at least prevent thefirewall router from listening to routing updates from the test network.You can do this a number of ways, depending on your network setup, whatyou're testing, and what routers you have available. You might do any ofthe following:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Use a different routing protocol from the one under test andentirely disable the protocol under test.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Tell the router not to accept any routing updates from theinterface under test and to filter out packets in the routing protocol.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Specify which hosts the router will accept updates from.</P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">If you have a number of test networks, you may find it best to set up aperimeter net for them and give each one a separate router onto theperimeter net, putting most of the packet filtering in the routerbetween the perimeter and the main network. That way, if one testnetwork crashes its router, the rest still have their normalconnectivity. <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch04_04.htm#FIRE-04-FIG-15"TITLE="Firewall architecture with a laboratory network">Figure 4.15</A> shows this architecture.</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-FIG-15">Figure 4.15: Firewall architecture with a laboratory network</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire0415.gif"ALT="Figure 4.15"><PCLASS="para">If your testing involves external connections, the test network has tobe treated as an external network itself; see &quot;Joint VentureFirewalls&quot; below.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-S2-16">4.4.2 Insecure Networks</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2297"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2300"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2302"></A>Test networks are dangerous, but not necessarily less secure thanother networks. Many organizations also have some networks that areintrinsically less secure than most. For example, a university mayconsider networks that run through student dormitories to beparticularly insecure; a company may consider demonstration networks,porting labs, and customer training networks to be particularlyinsecure. Nevertheless, these insecure networks need more interactionwith the rest of the organization than does a purely external network.</P><PCLASS="para">Networks like dormitory networks and porting labs, where externalpeople have prolonged access and the ability to bring in their owntools, are really as insecure as completely external networks andshould be treated that way. Either position them as a second externalconnection (a new connection on your exterior router or a new exteriorrouter) or set up a separate perimeter network for them. The onlyadvantage these networks offer over purely external networks is thatyou can specify particular software to be run on them, which means youcan make use of encryption effectively. (See <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch10_01.htm"TITLE="Authentication and Inbound Services">Chapter 10, <CITECLASS="chapter">Authentication and InboundServices</CITE></A> for a discussion of how to provide services toexternal, untrusted networks.)</P><PCLASS="para">Demonstration and training labs, where external people have relativelybrief, supervised access and cannot bring in tools, can be moretrusted (as long as you are sure that people really do haverelatively brief, supervised access and cannot bring in tools!). Youstill need to use a packet filtering router or a dual-homedhost to prevent confidential traffic from flowing across thosenetworks. You will also want to limit those networks to connections toservers you consider secure. However, you may be willing to provideNFS service from particular servers, for example, which you wouldn'tdo to a purely untrusted network. One of your main concerns should bepreventing your trusted users from doing unsafe things while workingon those networks (for example, logging in to the machines on theirdesks and forgetting to log out again, or reading confidentialelectronic mail). This should be done with a combination of trainingand force (ensuring that the most insecure uses fail).</P><PCLASS="para">This is a place where a dual-homed host can be quite useful, even withno proxies on it; the number of people who need to use the host isprobably small, and having to log into it will ensure that they seewarning messages. The host will also be unable to provide some temptingbut highly insecure services; for example, you won't be able to run NFSexcept from the dual-homed host, and people won't be able to mount theirhome machine's filesystems.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-S2-17">4.4.3 Extra-Secure Networks</A></H3><PCLASS="para">Just as most organizations have points where they're particularlyinsecure, most of them have points where they're particularlysecurity-conscious. At universities, these may be particular researchprojects, or the registrar's office; at commercial companies, these maybe new products under development; at almost any place, the accountingand finance machines need extra protection. Some unclassified governmentwork also requires extra protections. </P><PCLASS="para">Networks for doing classified work&nbsp;- at any level ofclassification&nbsp;- not only need to be more secure, but also need to meetall relevant government regulations. Generally speaking, they willhave to be separated from unclassified networks. In anycase, they are outside of the scope of this book. If you need to setone up, consult your security officer; traditional firewalls will notmeet the requirements.[5] </P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[5] If you don't have a security officer, you're not going to have aclassified network, either.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">You can choose to meet your requirements for extra security either byencrypting traffic that passes over your regular internalnetworks, or by setting up separate networks for the securetraffic. Separate networks are technically easier as long as thereare separate machines on them. That is, if you have a secure researchproject that owns particular computers, and if people log into themto work on that project, it's reasonably simple to set up astraightforward single-machine firewall (a packet filtering router,most likely). That firewall will treat your normal network as theinsecure external universe. Because the lab machines probably don'tneed many services, a bastion host is unnecessary, and aperimeter net is needed only for the most secret ventures.</P><PCLASS="para">If you are dealing with people whose day-to-day work is secure, and whodon't have separate machines for that work, a separate network becomesharder to implement. If you put their machines onto a moresecure network, they can't work easily with everybody else atthe site, and they need a number of services. In this case, you'll needa full bastion host, and therefore probably a perimeter net to put iton. It's tempting to connect their machines to <EMCLASS="emphasis">two</EM>networks, the secure net and the insecure net, so they can transmitconfidential data over one and participate with the rest of the site onthe other, but this is a configuration nightmare. If they're attached toboth at once, each host is basically a dual-homed host firewall, withall the attendant maintenance problems. If they can only be attached toone at a time, things are more secure. However, configuring the machinesis unpleasant for you, and moving back and forth is unpleasant for the user.</P><PCLASS="para">At a university, which tends not to have a single coherent network tostart with, putting the registrar's office and the financial people onsecure networks, firewalled from the rest of the university, willprobably work. At a company or government office, where most people workin the same environment, look into using encryption in your applicationsinstead.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-S2-18">4.4.4 Joint Venture Firewalls</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH04FWJOINT"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH04NETJOINT"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH04JOINTNET"></A>Sometimes, organizations come together for certain limited reasons,such as a joint project; they need to be able to share machines, data,and other resources for the duration of the project. For example, lookat the decision of <SPANCLASS="acronym">IBM</SPAN> and Apple to collaborate onthe Power<SPANCLASS="acronym">PC</SPAN>, a personal computer that runs acommon operating system; undertaking one joint projectdoesn't mean that <SPANCLASS="acronym">IBM</SPAN> and Apple have decided tomerge their organizations or to open up all their operations to eachother.</P><PCLASS="para">Although the two parties have decided to trust each other for thepurposes of this project, they are still competitors. They want toprotect most of their systems and information from each other. It isn'tjust that they may distrust each other; it's also that they can't besure how good the other's security is. They don't want to risk that anintruder into their partner's system might, through this joint venture,find a route into their system as well. This security problem occurseven if the collaborators aren't also competitors. </P><PCLASS="para">You may also want to connect to an external company because it is anoutside vendor to you. A number of services depend on informationtransfer, from shipping (you tell them what you want to ship; theytell you what happened to your shipment) to architecture (you givethem specifications; they give you designs) to chip fabrication (yousend them the chip design, they give you status on the fabricationprocess).  These outside vendors are not competitors in any sense,but they frequently also work for competitors of yours. They areprobably aware of confidentiality issues and try toprotect the information they are supposed to have, to the best oftheir ability. On the other hand, if there are routing slip-ups, anddata you're not explicitly sending to them crosses their networks,they are probably going to be completely unconscious of it, and thedata will be at risk.</P><PCLASS="para">This may seem far-fetched, but it turns out to be a fairly routineoccurrence. One company was mystified to discover routes on its networkfor a competitor's internal network, and still more baffled todiscover traffic using these routes. It turned out that the shortestroute between them and their competitor was through a common outsidevendor.  The traffic was not confidential, because it was all trafficthat would have gone through the Internet. On the other hand, theconnection to the outside vendor was not treated as if it were anInternet connection (the outside vendor itself was notInternet-connected, and nobody had considered the possibility of itcross-connecting Internet-connected clients). Both companies hadsudden, unexpected, and unprotected vulnerabilities.</P><PCLASS="para">An internal firewall limits exposure in such a situation. It providesa mechanism for sharing some resources, while protecting most of them.Before you set out to build an internal firewall, be sure you're clearon what you want to share, protect, and accomplish. Ask thesequestions:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">What exactly do you want to accomplish by linking your network withsome other organization's network? The answer to this question willdetermine what services you need to provide (and, by implication, whatservices should be blocked).</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Are you just looking to exchange email or files with the otherorganization privately, without having to communicate over theInternet?  If that's all you want, then maybe a dial-up<SPANCLASS="acronym">UUCP</SPAN> connection is all you need, not an<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>-level connection between your nets.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Are you trying to create a full work environment for a joint projectin which team members from both organizations can work together andyet still have access to their own &quot;home&quot; systems (whichneed to be protected from the other organization)? In such a case, youmight actually need two firewalls: one between the joint project netand each of the home organizations.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Are you looking for something in between? Exactly what you're tryingto accomplish, and what your security concerns are, will determinewhat firewall technologies are going to be useful to you.</P></LI></UL></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-S2-19">4.4.5 A Shared Perimeter Network Allowsan `Arms-length' Relationship</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2351"></A>Shared perimeter networks are a good way to approach joint networks. Eachparty can install its own router, under its own control, onto aperimeter net between the two organizations. In some configurations,these two routers might be the only machines on the perimeter net,with no bastion host. If this is the case, then the &quot;net&quot;might simply be a high-speed serial line (e.g., a 56 Kb/s orT1/E1 line) between the two routers, rather than an Ethernet oranother type of local area network.</P><PCLASS="para">This is highly desirable with an outside vendor. Most of them are notnetworking wizards, and they may attempt to economize by connectingmultiple clients to the same perimeter network. If the perimeter net isan Ethernet or something similar, any client that can get to itsrouter on that perimeter network can see the traffic for all the clientson that perimeter network&nbsp;- which, with some providers, is almostguaranteed to be confidential information belonging to a competitor.Using a point-to-point connection as the &quot;perimeter net&quot;between the outside vendor and each client, rather than a sharedmulticlient perimeter net, will prevent them from doing this, evenaccidentally. </P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-04-S2-20">4.4.6 An Internal Firewall May or May NotNeed Bastion Hosts</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2358"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2361"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2365"></A>You might not actually need to place a bastion host on the perimeternetwork between two organizations. The decision about whether you needa bastion host depends on what services are required for yourfirewall and how much each organization trusts the other. Bastionhosts on the perimeter net are rarely required for relationships withoutside vendors; usually you are sending data over one particularprotocol and can adequately protect that as a screened host.</P><PCLASS="para">If the organizations have a reasonable amount of trust in each other(and, by extension, in each other's security), it may bereasonable to establish the packet filters so that clients on theother side can connect to internal servers (such as<SPANCLASS="acronym">SMTP</SPAN> and <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> servers) directly.</P><PCLASS="para">On the other hand, if the organizations distrust each other, they mighteach want to place their own bastion host, under their own control andmanagement, on the perimeter net. Traffic would flow from one party'sinternal systems, to their bastion host, to the other party's bastionhost, and finally to the other party's internal systems.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2373"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2374"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2375"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2376"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2377"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2378"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2379"></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch04_03.htm"TITLE="4.3 Variations on Firewall Architectures"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 4.3 Variations on Firewall Architectures"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch04_05.htm"TITLE="4.5 What the Future Holds"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 4.5 What the Future Holds"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">4.3 Variations on Firewall Architectures</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">4.5 What the Future Holds</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
