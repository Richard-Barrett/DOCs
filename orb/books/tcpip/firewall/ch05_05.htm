Other types of networkinterfaces, such as <SPANCLASS="acronym">FDDI</SPAN>, may not be able tocapture all packets, but depending on the network architecture, theycan usually capture at least some packets not specifically addressedto them.</P><PCLASS="para">This capability has a useful purpose: for network analysis, testing,and debugging, e.g., by programs like <EMCLASS="emphasis">etherfind</EM>and <EMCLASS="emphasis">tcpdump</EM>.  Unfortunately, it can also be usedby an intruder to snoop on all traffic on a network segment. Thistraffic might include Telnet, <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN>, or<EMCLASS="emphasis">rlogin</EM> sessions (from which logins and passwordscan be captured), confidential email, <SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN> accessesof sensitive files, and so on. You need to assume the worst: thebastion host can be compromised. If it is compromised, you don't wantthe bastion host to snoop on this traffic.</P><PCLASS="para">One way to approach the problem is to not put the bastion host on aninternal network; instead, put it on a perimeter network. As we'vediscussed in earlier chapters, a perimeter network is an additionallayer of security between your internal network and the Internet. Theperimeter network is separated from the internal network by a router orbridge. Internal traffic stays on the internal net and is not visibleon the perimeter net. All the bastion host on a perimeter network cansee are packets that are either to or from itself, or to or from theInternet. Although this traffic might still be somewhat sensitive, it'slikely to be a lot less sensitive than your typical internal networktraffic, and there are other places (for instance, your Internet serviceprovider) that can already see much of it. </P><PCLASS="para">Using a perimeter net with a packet filtering router between it and theinternal network gives you some additional advantages. It further limitsyour exposure, if the bastion host is compromised, by reducing the numberof hosts and services the bastion host can access. </P><PCLASS="para">If you can't put the bastion host on a perimeter network, you mightconsider putting it on a network that's not susceptible tosnooping. For example, you might put it on an intelligent 10baseT hub,an Ethernet switch, or an <SPANCLASS="acronym">ATM</SPAN> network. If you doonly this, you need to take additional care to make sure that nothingtrusts the bastion host, because there's no further layer ofprotection between it and the internal network. Using such a networktechnology for your perimeter network is the best of both worlds: thebastion host is isolated from internal systems (as with a traditionalperimeter network) but can't snoop on traffic on the perimeternetwork.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch05_04.htm"TITLE="5.4 Choosing a Physical Location"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 5.4 Choosing a Physical Location"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch05_06.htm"TITLE="5.6 Selecting Services Provided by the Bastion Host"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 5.6 Selecting Services Provided by the Bastion Host"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">5.4 Choosing a Physical Location</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">5.6 Selecting Services Provided by the Bastion Host</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
