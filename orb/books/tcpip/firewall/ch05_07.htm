There are several reasons why, including:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Vulnerabilities of the accounts themselves</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Vulnerabilities of the services required to support the accounts</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Reduced stability and reliability of the machine</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Inadvertent subversion of the bastion host's security by users</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Increased difficulty in detecting attacks</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">User accounts provide relatively easy avenues of attack for someonewho is intent on breaking into the bastion host. Each account usuallyhas a reusable password[3]that can be attacked through a variety of means, including dictionarysearches, brute force searches, or capture by network eavesdropping.Multiply this by many users, and you have a disaster in the making.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[3] We discuss ways to support nonreusable passwords in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch10_01.htm"TITLE="Authentication and Inbound Services">Chapter 10, <CITECLASS="chapter">Authentication and InboundServices</CITE></A>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Supporting user accounts in any useful fashion requires the bastionhost to enable services (for example, printing and local mail deliveryservices) that could otherwise be disabled on the bastion host. Everyservice that is available on the bastion host provides another avenueof attack, through software bugs or configuration errors.</P><PCLASS="para">Having to support user accounts also can reduce the stability andreliability of the machine itself. Machines that do not support useraccounts tend to run predictably and are stable. Many sites have foundthat machines without users tend to run pretty much indefinitely (orat least until the power fails) without crashing.</P><PCLASS="para">Users themselves can contribute to security problems on the bastionhost. They don't (usually) do it deliberately, but they can subvert thesystem in a variety of ways. These range from trivial (e.g., choosing apoor password) to complex (e.g., setting up an unauthorized informationserver that has unknown security implications). Users are seldom tryingto be malicious; they're normally just trying to get their own jobs donemore efficiently and effectively.</P><PCLASS="para">It's usually easier to tell if everything is &quot;runningnormally&quot; on a machine that doesn't have user accounts muddyingthe waters. Users behave in unpredictable ways, but you want a bastionhost to have a predictable usage pattern, in order to detectintrusions by watching for interruptions in the pattern. </P><PCLASS="para">If you need to allow user accounts on the bastion host, keep them to aminimum. Add accounts individually, monitor them carefully, andregularly verify that they're still needed. </P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch05_06.htm"TITLE="5.6 Selecting Services Provided by the Bastion Host"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 5.6 Selecting Services Provided by the Bastion Host"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch05_08.htm"TITLE="5.8 Building a Bastion Host"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 5.8 Building a Bastion Host"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">5.6 Selecting Services Provided by the Bastion Host</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">5.8 Building a Bastion Host</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
