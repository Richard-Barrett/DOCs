A typical packet crossing a firewallwould be a <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> packet because most Internetservices are <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN>-based. The minimum possible<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> packet size, for a packet containing onlythe <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> header and <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN> header andno actual data, is 40 bytes, which cuts the maximum packet rates inhalf, to 175 packets per second for a 56-Kb/s lineand 4825 packets per second for a 1.544-Mb/sline. Real packets containing real data are going to be larger still,reducing the packet-per-second rates still further.</P><PCLASS="para">These per-second packet rates are well within the capabilities of manyof the packet filtering systems, both commercial and freely availableoff the Internet, that are available today. Some can go much faster. </P><PCLASS="para">Speed is likely to be more of an issue in a firewall that is internalto an organization's network. Such a firewall will need to run at<SPANCLASS="acronym">LAN</SPAN> speeds, which are usually theoretically atleast 10 Mb/s, and may be much higher. (Firewallsare not practical within a gigabit-per-second network at thispoint. Fortunately, from a firewalls perspective, such networks arerare at present.)</P><PCLASS="para">A firewall with more than two connections may also have higher speedrequirements. With two connections, the maximum required speed is thatof the slowest connection. With three connections, the required speedcan rise. For example, if you put a second Internet connection onto anexternal router, it now needs to drive both atfull speed if it's not going to be a limiting factor. If you put twointernal networks onto it, it's going to need to achieve the higherLAN speed to route between the two internal networks. </P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-06-S2-21">6.8.2 It Can Be a Single-Purpose Router ora General-Purpose Computer</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-5773"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-5776"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-5778"></A>Don't expect a single device to serve as your packet-filtering routerand also to do something that's not part of your firewall. (You may havea device that's doing packet filtering and proxying, or packet filteringand selected bastion host services, or even all three.) In a practicalsense, you should expect to be using a dedicated packet-filteringrouter. This doesn't mean you have to buy a single-purpose router,however. You might choose to use either a traditional, single-purposerouter, or a general-purpose computer dedicated to routing. What are the pros and cons of each choice?</P><PCLASS="para">If you have a large number of networks or multiple protocols, you willprobably need a single-purpose router. Routing packages forgeneral-purpose computers usually do not have the speed or flexibilityof single-purpose routers, and you may find you will need aninconveniently large machine to accommodate the necessary interfaceboards.</P><PCLASS="para">On the other hand, if you are filtering a single Internet link, youmay not need to do any more than route <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>packets between two Ethernets. This is well within the capabilities ofa reasonable 486-based (or comparable) computer, and such a machinemay well be cheaper than a single-purpose router. (It may even befree, if you already have one available within your organization.)Routing and filtering packages are available for<SPANCLASS="acronym">MS-DOS</SPAN> and most variants of<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>. (See <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appb_01.htm"TITLE="Tools">Appendix B</A> forinformation about available packages.)</P><PCLASS="para">Whatever device you use for your filtering router, firewalling shouldbe all the router does. For example, if possible, don't use onedevice as both your filtering router and the backbone router that tiestogether multiple separate internal networks. Instead, use one deviceto tie together your internal networks and a separate (muchsmaller) device as your filtering router. The more complex thefiltering router and its configuration, the more likely it is thatyou'll make a mistake in its configuration, which could have serioussecurity implications. Filtering also has a significant speed impacton a router and may slow the router down to the point where it hasdifficulty achieving acceptable performance for the internal networks.</P><PCLASS="para">Some commercial firewall packages combine packet filtering withproxying on a machine that behaves like a single-purposerouter. Others combine packet filtering with proxying or bastion hostservices on a high-powered general-purpose computer. This is fine,although it will increase your speed requirements. Don't expect to usea small machine to do this. Depending on what machines you haveavailable, this may either be a good bargain (you buy a singlelarge machine instead of multiple medium-sized ones) or a bad one (youbuy a single large machine instead of adding a small machine to anexisting configuration). As we've said in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch04_01.htm"TITLE="Firewall Design">Chapter 4</A>, combining the bastion host with the externalpacket filter is a reasonable thing to do from a securityperspective.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-06-S2-22">6.8.3 It Should Allow Simple Specificationof Rules</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-5792"></A>You want to be able to specify the rules for your packet filtering assimply as possible.

This makes it impossible to specify certain kinds offilters. Some manufacturers who omit<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN>/<SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> source ports from packetfiltering criteria maintain that such filtering isn't useful anyway,or that its proper use is &quot;too dangerous&quot; for customers tounderstand (because, as we've pointed out above, source portinformation is not reliable). We believe that this is a fallacy, andthat such decisions are better left to well-informed customers.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-5835"></A>Let's consider an example in which filters based on source port mightbe useful&nbsp;- access to Archie servers. As we discuss in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A>, Archie access presents some troublesomeproblems. The biggest is that the native Archie protocol is<SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN>-based, and at Internet firewalls<SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> is generally blocked altogether (except forsmall &quot;peepholes&quot; for services such as<SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN>, <SPANCLASS="acronym">NTP</SPAN>, and Archie). Thereason for this blocking is usually to prevent outsiders fromattacking <SPANCLASS="acronym">RPC</SPAN>-based services like<SPANCLASS="acronym">NIS/YP</SPAN> and <SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN>. Because<SPANCLASS="acronym">RPC</SPAN>-based services don't run on fixed port numbers,you can't simply block access to the ports the<SPANCLASS="acronym">RPC</SPAN>-based services run on (because you don't knowwhat they are). Unlike <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN>, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN>doesn't have <SPANCLASS="acronym">ACK</SPAN> bits; thus, you can't dostart-of-connection filtering. The packet filteringsystem can't tell, just by examining an incoming packet, whether thatpacket is a response from an external server to an internal client, ora command from an external client (possibly an attack program) to aninternal server (such as <SPANCLASS="acronym">NIS/YP</SPAN> or<SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN>). With all of these obstacles, how, then, doyou construct a rule set to allow Archie?</P><PCLASS="para">One of the characteristics of Archie is that there are only 20 or soArchie servers in the world. For performance reasons, your users willgenerally only want to talk to the handful of those servers that are&quot;near&quot; your site in the network topology (for example,there are only five servers in the United States). If you're willingto make certain assumptions about the security of the Archie servers(we discuss these in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8</A>), you could enableArchie access for your users by allowing packets out to the Archieservers, and by allowing packets back in from theArchie servers (using source port filtering to determine this).</P><PCLASS="para">This is somewhat risky. If someone forges packets from port 1525 atan Archie server to an internal <SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN> server,they will succeed in getting responses from you. In order to do that,they need to guess that you might allow such packets, figure out aninternal host address and the port that its <SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN>server is on, forge the packets, and intercept the answers. None ofthis is impossibly difficult for an attacker to do, although it'sarguably more trouble than most attackers are willing to go to toattack most sites. Note that <SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN> packets normallyfragment, and fragments are normally passed through packet filters, sothey will probably succeed in getting some data (all but the firstfragment of each <SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN> packet) even if your packetfilter is smart enough to block outbound <SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN> byexamining application-level protocol information. If you are facingdetermined attackers, this type of filtering is not sufficientlysecure.</P><PCLASS="para">The following table shows a simple rule set that allows internal clientsto interact with a known Archie server, and that disallows everythingelse.

In this example, we are considering a relatively simplesituation, and we've still managed to come up with a rule set that had asubtle error in it. Real-life rule sets are significantly more complexthan these, and often include tens or hundreds of rules. Consideringthe implications and interactions of all those rules is nearlyimpossible, unless they are simply applied in the order specified. So-called &quot;help&quot; from a router, in the form of reorderingrule sets, can easily turn an over-specified but working rule set into anonworking rule set.

In this section, we'll show an example thatdemonstrates the problems you can run into with routers that aren't thatflexible.</P><PCLASS="para">A limitation unfortunately shared by many packet filteringsystems is that they let you examine packets only as they are leavingthe system.

If a router lets you look only atoutgoing packets, then packets directed to the router itself are neversubjected to packet filtering. The result is that the filteringdoesn't protect the router itself. This is usually not too serious aproblem, because there are typically few services on the router thatcould be attacked, and there are other ways to protect thoseservices. Telnet is an example of a service that can be attacked inthis way, but you can usually get around the routing problem bydisabling the Telnet server, or by controlling from where it willaccept incoming connections. <SPANCLASS="acronym">SNMP</SPAN> is anothercommonly available and vulnerable service.</P><PCLASS="para">Now consider the second problem. If a router can only filter outgoingpackets, it's difficult or impossible to detect forged packets beinginjected from the outside (that is, packets coming in from theoutside, but which claim to have internal source addresses),as is illustrated in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch06_01.htm#FIRE-06-FIG-1"TITLE="Source address forgery">Figure 6.1</A>.Forgery detection is most easily done when the packet enters the router, onthe inbound interface. Detecting forgeries on the outbound interfaceis complicated by packets generated by the router itself (which willhave internal source addresses if the router itself has an internaladdress) and by legitimate internal packets mistakenly directed to therouter (packets that should have been sent directly from theirinternal source to their internal destinations, but were instead sentto the filtering router, for instance by systems following a defaultroute that leads to the filtering router).</P><PCLASS="para">The third problem with outbound-only filtering is that it can bedifficult to configure packet filtering on such a router when it hasmore than two interfaces. If it has only two interfaces, thenbeing able to do only outbound filtering on each interface is no big deal. There are only two paths through the router (from the first interface tothe second, and vice versa). Packets going one way can be filtered asoutgoing packets on one interface, while packets going the other way canbe filtered as outgoing packets on the other interface. Consider, onthe other hand, a router with four interfaces: one for the site'sInternet connection, one for a finance network, and two for engineeringnetworks. In such an environment, it wouldn't be unreasonable to wantto impose the following policy:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">The two engineering networks can communicate with each otherwithout restrictions.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">The two engineering networks and the Internet can communicate witheach other with certain restrictions.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">The two engineering networks and the finance network cancommunicate with each other with certain restrictions&nbsp;- restrictionsthat are different from those between the engineering nets and theInternet.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">The finance network cannot communicate with the Internet under anycircumstances.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch06_08.htm#FIRE-06-FIG-9"TITLE="Packet filtering restrictions on different interfaces">Figure 6.9</A> illustrates this environment.</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-06-FIG-9">Figure 6.9: Packet filtering restrictions on different interfaces</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire0609.gif"ALT="Figure 6.9"><PCLASS="para">There are 12 paths through this router, from each of four interfaces toeach of three other interfaces (in general, there are N * N-1 pathsthrough an N-interface router).

Depending on the complexity of the filters and theflexibility of the filtering system, it may actually be impossible insome situations. </P><PCLASS="para">A more subtle problem with such a setup is that it imposes packetfiltering overhead between the two engineering networks (which mayresult in a significant performance problem). With this setup, therouter has to examine all the packets flowing between the twoengineering nets, even though it will never decide to drop any of thosepackets.</P><PCLASS="para">Now look at the same scenario, assuming that the packet filtering systemhas both inbound and outbound filters.

A system of this kind would address the firstproblem we described in this section: a router with inbound-onlyfilters <EMCLASS="emphasis">can</EM> be protected by its own filters. However, such a system would not address the second and more seriousproblem; you still have problems merging filtering rules onrouters with more than two interfaces.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-06-S2-26">6.8.7 It Should Be Able to Log Accepted andDropped Packets</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-6321"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-6324"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-6327"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-6329"></A>Make sure the packet filtering router gives you the option of loggingall of the packets it drops. You want to know about any packets thatare blocked by your packet filtering rules. These rules reflect yoursecurity policy and you want to know when somebody attempts to violatethat policy. The simplest way to learn about these attemptedviolations is through such a log.</P><PCLASS="para">You'd also like to be able to log selected packets that were accepted.For example, you might want to log the start of each<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN> connection. Logging all accepted packets isgoing to be too much data in normal operation, but may be worth itoccasionally for debugging and for dealing with attacks inprogress. Although you will probably be doing some logging at thepacket destination, that logging won't work if the destination hosthas been compromised, and won't show packets that make it through thepacket filter but don't have a valid destination. Those packets areinteresting, because they may be probes from an attacker. Withoutinformation from the router, you won't have the complete picture ofwhat the attacker is doing.</P><PCLASS="para">The logging should be flexible; the packet filter should give you theability to log via <EMCLASS="emphasis">syslog</EM> and to a console or alocal file.

In the few products thatprovide any kinds of testing capabilities, what the test says it willdo with a given packet and what it actually does with such a packetare sometimes different, often because of subtle caching andoptimization bugs. Some sites (and, we hope, some vendors!) haveconstructed filtering test beds, where they can generate test packetson one side of a filtering router and watch to see what comes throughto the other side, but that's beyond the capabilities and resources ofmost sites. About the best you can do is pick something with a goodreputation for not having many problems and good support for when itinevitably does have problems.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-6359"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-6360"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-6361"></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch06_07.htm"TITLE="6.7 Filtering by Service"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 6.7 Filtering by Service"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch06_09.htm"TITLE="6.9 Where to Do Packet Filtering"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 6.9 Where to Do Packet Filtering"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">6.7 Filtering by Service</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">6.9 Where to Do Packet Filtering</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
