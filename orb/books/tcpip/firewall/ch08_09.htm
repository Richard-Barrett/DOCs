Each of their screens getssplit into two sections; what one person types appears in one section;what the other person types appears in the other section.</P><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> is very convoluted in that it uses<SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> to negotiate the connections between the twosites and then uses <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN> to actually move the databack and forth between the participants. <SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> isused between the calling client and the answering server, and againbetween the answering client and the calling server;<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN> is then used between the two clients.</P><PCLASS="para">To further complicate matters, there are two incompatible versions ofthe <EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> protocol, commonly referred to as either<EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> and <EMCLASS="emphasis">ntalk</EM> (for&quot;new talk&quot;) or <EMCLASS="emphasis">otalk</EM> (for &quot;oldtalk&quot;) and <EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM>, depending on who youask. The earlier version depended on bytes being in a certain order inmemory, and basically worked only between machines of the same<SPANCLASS="acronym">CPU</SPAN> type. The later version fixes this problem, butis incompatible with the earlier version.</P><PCLASS="para">The calling client contacts the answering server via<SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> to announce the call. The answering servertells the user being called that someone is requesting a<EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> session and how he should respond if he wishes to accept the call. While waiting for the user to respond, thecalling client also contacts the calling server to say that it'sexpecting an incoming call and to specify what <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN>port it wishes to use for that call (somewhat like calling yoursecretary to say that you're expecting a call back from someone, andthat it should be put through to the extension you're currentlyat). When the answering user accepts, that user's client (theanswering client) contacts the calling server via<SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> to find out what port the calling client iswaiting on; the answering client then contacts the calling client onthat <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN> port. <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_09.htm#FIRE-08-FIG-11"TITLE="How talk works">Figure 8.11</A>shows how <EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> works.</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-08-FIG-11">Figure 8.11: How talk works</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire0811.gif"ALT="Figure 8.11"><PCLASS="para">Because of the incompatible <EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> protocols,<EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> fails relatively often even between sitesthat do no packet filtering, or between machines of different typeswithin the same site. <EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> clients and serversare generally provided only on <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> machines.</P><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-08-S3-61">8.9.1.1 Packet filtering characteristics oftalk</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-12505"></A><EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> servers (which broker connections between<EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> clients, and then get out of the way) useeither <SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> port 517 (for old versions of<EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM>) or <SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> port 518 (fornewer versions). <EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> clients use<SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> ports above 1023 to interact with<EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> servers. <EMCLASS="emphasis">talk</EM> clientsalso use <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN> ports above 1023 to interact with eachother.

For example, they think it's really neat to distributesoftware by putting up a little server on their machine, and advisingpeople to &quot;telnet myhost myport | sh&quot; to have thesoftware installed for them, which allows external users to installthe software without interaction from the user, but would also letthem run any command whatsoever on the internal user's host as thatuser. It's close to impossible to distinguishhostile people from naive ones,and users should be advised to never issue any command, in or out oftheir <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN> client, just because somebody advisedthem to over <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN>.</P><PCLASS="para">Although these problems are widespread on <SPANCLASS="acronym">IRC</SPAN>, IRCis also a useful and popular way for people to talk to eachother.

Withsuch applications, you may have a number of stations all receiving thesame stream of packets, and the stream may consume a significantfraction of the available network bandwidth. If a given stream consumes10% of your available network bandwidth (which is not uncommon), youwouldn't want to unicast it to each interested host, because each ofthese unicasts would consume another 10% of your bandwidth, limiting youto 10 participating hosts, and that assumes that you did nothing elsewith the network. You also wouldn't want to broadcast it to all hostsunless all (or almost all) of your hosts were actually interested in thestream, because it places a significant load on each host to process abroadcast packet and then decide to ignore it.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH08IPM"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-13016"></A><SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> multicasting provides a way to send packets togroups of <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> hosts. With <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>multicasting, groups of hosts that wish to receive a particular typeof packet (e.g., a particular video stream) are assigned an<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> multicast address they all share. An<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> multicast address looks like a normal<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> address in the range 224.0.0.0 through239.255.255.255. <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> multicast addresses are onlyused as destination addresses; they are never valid as sourceaddresses (multicast packets use the regular <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>address of the sending host as their source address).</P><PCLASS="para">Multicast groups are somewhat like cable television channels. Thereare a variety of channels (multicast groups) available, such as<SPANCLASS="acronym">HBO</SPAN>, <SPANCLASS="acronym">CNN</SPAN>,<SPANCLASS="acronym">ESPN</SPAN>, and <SPANCLASS="acronym">MTV</SPAN>, but most homes(hosts) subscribe to only a few of the available channels. Somemulticast groups are permanent; that is, certainaddresses are reserved for certain uses, such as Internet EngineeringTask Force (<SPANCLASS="acronym">IETF</SPAN>) meetings, <SPANCLASS="acronym">NASA</SPAN>select video feeds (whenever the space shuttle is in orbit), and soon. Other multicast groups are transient: set up for a particularpurpose or event and then shut down when they are no longer needed, tobe reused for something else later on.</P><PCLASS="para">Multicasting is being used on the Internet today primarily forreal-time conferencing services, including video, audio, andelectronic whiteboard services. It's starting to be used for otherservices as well, such as transmitting Usenet newsefficiently to a wide body of recipients.</P><PCLASS="para">Commercial products, such as routers and hosts, are just starting tosupport multicasting. Some networking technologies such as Ethernet support multicast directly. You can send an Ethernet packetof information to a magic Ethernet address on a given Ethernetsegment, and all hosts on that segment that are listening for thatEthernet address will receive that packet. Other networkingtechnologies, e.g., point-to-point leased lines, don't supportmulticast, so the effect has to be faked by turning a multicast packetinto a series of duplicate unicast packets, each addressed to one ofthe multicast participants.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="CH08TUNNEL"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-13039"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-13041"></A>Obviously, you want to limit the number of duplicate unicast packetson these point-to-point leased lines, so a common approach to linkingtwo multicast-capable networks (such as Ethernets) over a unicast-onlynetwork (such as a T1 leased line) is to create a<EMCLASS="emphasis">tunnel</EM> over the unicast network, with multicastrouters (often called <EMCLASS="emphasis">mrouters</EM>) at either end ofthe tunnel. These <EMCLASS="emphasis">mrouters</EM> take multicast<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> packets, encapsulate them into unicast<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> packets, and send them (via regular<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> unicast) through the tunnel to the<EMCLASS="emphasis">mrouter</EM> on the other end, which unencapsulatesthem to turn them back into multicast <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>packets. By creating a web of <EMCLASS="emphasis">mrouters</EM> andtunnels, you can create a virtual multicast network on top of aunicast backbone.</P><PCLASS="para">The <SPANCLASS="acronym">MBONE</SPAN> is the ad hoc Multicast Backbone on theInternet, and is just such a web of <EMCLASS="emphasis">mrouters</EM> andtunnels.

If a site uses tunneling to take part in the<SPANCLASS="acronym">MBONE</SPAN>, what do the packets for the tunnels looklike? What could be sent through the tunnels? If a site doesn't usetunnels, but uses <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> multicasting directly, howwill the site's packet filtering system deal with it? Cannonmulticast services (such as <SPANCLASS="acronym">SMTP</SPAN>,<SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN>, <SPANCLASS="acronym">NIS/YP</SPAN>, and so on) beaccessed by attackers via multicast, whether tunneled or not?</P><PCLASS="para"><SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> multicast tunneling is currently done with<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>-in-<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> encapsulation. That is,a multicast <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> packet is encapsulated into aregular <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> packet, in much the same way that a<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN> or <SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> packet normallyis. Instead of the usual <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> packet containing a<SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> packet, for example, you have an IP unicastpacket that contains an <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> multicast packet that,in turn, contains a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> packet. Thus, if tunneledmulticast packets need to cross a packet filtering system, the systemneeds to recognize <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>-in-<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>packets, in much the same way that it recognizes<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN>, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN>, and<SPANCLASS="acronym">ICMP</SPAN> packets. If your packet filtering systemdoesn't recognize <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>-in-<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> byname, but will allow you to specify protocol numbers instead, you needto know that <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>-in-<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> isprotocol number 4 (for comparison, <SPANCLASS="acronym">ICMP</SPAN> is 1,<SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP</SPAN> is 6, and <SPANCLASS="acronym">UDP</SPAN> is 17).</P><PCLASS="para"><SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> multicast tunnels used to be done withsource-routed <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> packets, but this practice causeda number of problems (not the least of which was upsetting folks whohad firewalls), and it is no longer recommended.</P><PCLASS="para">To prevent a multicast tunnel from being used as a back door into orout of a network, the current publicly available<EMCLASS="emphasis">mrouter</EM> code will only accept multicast packetsthrough the tunnel; it won't accept unicast packets shoved through thetunnel in an attempt to bypass your firewall. If you're using acommercial multicast router, rather than the publicly available codeoff the Internet, you should verify that it will behave in a similarway.</P><PCLASS="para">If you have routers and a network topology that support multicastdirectly, without tunnels, you still have to worry about how anypacket filtering system you use is going to cope with it. It shouldn'tbe too difficult, though, because from a packet filtering point ofview, multicast packets just look like regular packets with somewhatunusual destination addresses (in the range 224.0.0.0 through239.255.255.255). Treat them just as you would anything else: blockthem all by default and allow the ones you understand and wantto support. Keep in mind that each of these multicast addresses isgoing to apply to multiple internal machines, and that if you'reaccepting multicast packets from the outside world, then all of theinternal machines that are accepting those packets will have to beprotected against attack from the outside world&nbsp;- just as if you wereaccepting any other packets directly from the outside world.</P><PCLASS="para">Even if your tunnel is restricted to only multicast packets, or ifyou're using multicast directly without tunneling, there is still thequestion of how your hosts will respond to multicast packets addressedto regular ports, such as your <SPANCLASS="acronym">NIS/YP</SPAN> and<SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN> ports. Unfortunately, behavior varies fromoperating system to operating system, and even from release to releasewithin the same operating system. If your operating system's code isbased on Release 3.3 or later of the &quot;<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>Multicast Extensions for <SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN>-Derived<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> Systems&quot; from Xerox<SPANCLASS="acronym">PARC</SPAN> and the University of Delaware, then yoursystem should be safe against these kinds of attacks. Unless youinstalled the multicast extensions yourself, however, you could have avery difficult time determining what your operating system's multicastcode is based on. (Your best bet is to ask your vendor, but don't besurprised if it's difficult to find anybody who knows.)<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-13104"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-13105"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-13106"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-13107"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-13108"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-13109"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-13110"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-13111"></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch08_08.htm"TITLE="8.8 Information Lookup Services"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 8.8 Information Lookup Services"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch08_10.htm"TITLE="8.10 Domain Name System (DNS)"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 8.10 Domain Name System (DNS)"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">8.8 Information Lookup Services</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">8.10 Domain Name System (DNS)</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
