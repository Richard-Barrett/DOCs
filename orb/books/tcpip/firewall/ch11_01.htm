That's not the kind of policywe're discussing in this chapter. </P><PCLASS="para">The policy we're talking about here is like a nation's foreign policy.It might be discussed in documents&nbsp;- of varying amounts oflegibility&nbsp;- but its primary purpose is to lay out a direction, atheory of what you're trying to achieve. People sometimes confuse thewords &quot;policy,&quot; &quot;strategy,&quot; and&quot;tactics.&quot; A <EMCLASS="emphasis">policy</EM> is whatdetermines what wars you're going to fight and why. A <EMCLASS="emphasis">strategy</EM> is the plan for carrying out the war. A<EMCLASS="emphasis">tactic</EM> is a method for carrying out a strategy.Presidents determine policy; generals determine strategies; andanybody down to a foot soldier might determine a tactic.</P><PCLASS="para">Most of this book is about tactics. The tactics involved in building afirewall, the nitty-gritty details of what needs to be done here, arecomplex and intricate. However, no matter how good your tactics are, ifyour strategy and policy are bad, you can't succeed. In the 1800s, anAmerican named William Walker set out to conquer Nicaragua for theUnited States. His strategy and tactics were, if not impeccable,certainly successful: he conquered Nicaragua. Unfortunately, there wasa literal fatal flaw in his plan. The United States did not at the timewant Nicaragua, and when he announced that he had conquered it, the U.S.government was completely uninterested in doing anything about it.Walker ended up ruling Nicaragua very briefly, before he was killed in apopular uprising. This was the result of getting the strategy and thetactics right, but completely botching the policy.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S1-1">11.1 Your Security Policy</A></H2><PCLASS="para">Most technical computer people consider a single, unified, publishedsecurity policy to be desirable in the abstract, but believe&nbsp;- with astrong basis in personal experience&nbsp;- that attempting to come up withone is going to be extremely painful. For example, walk up to anysystem administrator and ask about users and passwords, and you arealmost guaranteed to be rewarded with a rant. Everybody has a storyabout the apparent insanity of people faced with passwords, one of thesimplest and most comprehensible security issues: the professor whoexplained that he was too important to need a good password; themathematician who was told that he couldn't use a password because itwas in an English dictionary (and who replied that he wasn't using the<EMCLASS="emphasis">English</EM> word that was spelled that way, he wasusing the <EMCLASS="emphasis">Russian</EM> word that was spelled that way,and nobody had told him not to use Russian words). This kind ofexperience is apt to convince system administrators that their usercommunity is incapable of dealing intelligently with security issues. </P><PCLASS="para">There is no doubt that putting together a security policy is going to bea long, involved process, and that it's the exact opposite of the typesof tasks most technical people enjoy. If you like to program, youare extremely unlikely to enjoy either the meetings or the bureaucracyinvolved in policy making. On the other hand, putting together asecurity policy is a great deal more amusing than dealing with theside effects of not having a policy. In the long run, you'll spend lesstime in meetings arguing about security if you get it out of the wayahead of time.</P><PCLASS="para">Developing a security policy also doesn't need to be as bad as you maybe expecting. Many of the problems with security policies are causedby people who are trying to write a security policy that sounds like asecurity policy, which is to say that it's written in big legal andtechnical words and says threatening things about how users had betterbehave themselves. This doesn't work. It's also the most unpleasantway to do things, because it involves hostility and incomprehensionall around. It's true that your organization may at some point need asecurity policy that's written in big legal words (to satisfy some biglegal requirements). In that case, the security policy you writeshouldn't contradict the legalistic document, but the policy you writedoesn't need to be that legalistic one.</P><PCLASS="para">Another problem people have in trying to write security policies isthat they have a strong feeling about what the policy ought to be, andthey're uncomfortable that the actual policy they enforce does notmeet that standard. There is a great deal of lip service paid to thenotion that security should be absolute: you should have a site thatnobody could ever break in to; where every user has exactly oneaccount, and every account has exactly one user; and where all thepasswords are excellent, and nobody ever uses anybody else's passwordfor anything.</P><PCLASS="para">In the real world, nobody's site is like that, a fact that is well-knownand well-accepted. That doesn't keep people from claiming that they wantto make their site like that, sometimes in big words on many pieces ofpaper that they call a security policy. Invariably, every time, withoutexception, these policies are not followed by anybody.</P><PCLASS="para">It's unlikely that your policy is one that emphasizessecurity at all costs. Such a policy would be irrational. It isreasonable to value other things highly enough to be willingto compromise security. </P><PCLASS="para">Most houses would be more secure with bars over all the windows. Fewpeople are willing to put bars over their windows, despite a desire toprotect themselves. People have a number of reasons for compromisingtheir security in this way. To start with, bars are expensive and theyinterfere with using the windows for many of their normal purposes(e.g., seeing out of, climbing out of in an emergency). But people arewilling to go to equal expense and inconvenience to apply other securitysolutions, and they may avoid barring windows even when it's thecheapest and most convenient solution, because it looks bad and makesthem feel oppressed.</P><PCLASS="para">This is entirely reasonable, and it's entirely reasonable to make thesame type of decision about your computer security. You may not wantthe best security money can buy, or even the best security you canafford. </P><PCLASS="para">What do you want? You want the best security that meets yourrequirements for:<DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Affordability</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">How much money does the security cost?</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Functionality</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Can you still use your computers?</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Cultural compatibility</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Does it conflict with the way people at your site normally interactwith each other and the outside world?</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Legality</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Does it meet the your site's legal requirements?</P></DD></DL></P><PCLASS="para">Don't pretend that you want to be absolutely secure, if only you couldafford it. You don't live your life with the most perfect security moneycould buy. For the same reasons, it's extremely unlikely that yourinstitution can maintain the characteristics that are important to it ifit also installs the most perfect security money could buy. Peopledon't like learning or working in a hostile environment; because theywon't do it, you'll either lose the security or lose the organization. </P><PCLASS="para">Sometimes a small concession to insecurity can buy a large payoff inmorale. For example, rulemakers reel at the idea of guest accounts, buta guest account for a spouse can make a big difference in how peoplefeel about work. And there are sometimes unexpected results.One university computer center was asked why its student employees wereallowed to hang around at all hours, even after the labs were closed,doing random activities of dubious value to the computer center; itseemed insecure at best. The answer was that several years before, anoperator who was typing his girlfriend's term paper in a lab after hourshad discovered and responded to a critical emergency. Because he hadsaved the facility from what seemed likely to be a million dollars worthof uninsured damage (insurance companies have a nasty tendency toconsider floods in windowless third-floor computer rooms to be acts ofGod, and thus uninsurable), the computer facility management figuredthat all the computer time the operators wanted had already been paidfor. </P><PCLASS="para">On the other hand, if you have too little security, you can lose theorganization to lawyers or attackers, and what matters there is what youdo, not what you write down. Writing down marvelous policies that don'tget enforced certainly won't save you from people who are trying tobreak into your computer, and it generally won't save you from lawsuits,either. The law counts only policies that you make some attempt toenforce. Writing it down and brazenly not doing it proves that youaren't simply too stupid to know what to do: it demonstrates that youactually knew what you had to do, and didn't do it!</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S2-1">11.1.1 What Should a Security Policy Contain?</A></H3><PCLASS="para">First and foremost, a security policy is a way of communicating withusers and managers. It should tell them what they need to know to makethe decisions they need to make about security.</P><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S3-1">11.1.1.1 Explanations</A></H4><PCLASS="para">It's important that the policy be explicit and understandableabout why certain decisions have been made. Most people will not followrules unless they understand why they're important. A policy thatspecifies what's supposed to be done, but not why, is doomed. As soon asthe people who wrote it leave, or forget why they made those decisions,it's going to stop having any effect.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S3-2">11.1.1.2 Everybody's responsibilities</A></H4><PCLASS="para">A policy sets explicit expectations and responsibilities among you, yourusers, and your management; it lets all of you know what to expect fromeach other. It's a mistake to distribute a policy that concentratesentirely on what users need to do to make the site secure (it seemshostile and unfair), or entirely on what system administrators need todo (it encourages the users to believe that somebody else will handle it,and they don't have to worry about it). </P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S3-3">11.1.1.3 Regular language</A></H4><PCLASS="para">Most people are not lawyers, and they're not security experts. They'recomfortable with casual descriptions. You may be afraid to write apolicy that way because it may seem uncomfortably casual and toopersonal. But it's more important to make your security policyfriendly and understandable than to make it precise andofficial-looking. Write it as if you were explaining it to a reasonablybright but nontechnical friend. Keep it a communication between peers,not a memo from Mount Olympus. If that's not acceptable in yourcorporate culture, write two separate policy descriptions. </P><PCLASS="para">You will not get people to comply unless they understand the documentand want to comply with it, and that means they have to at least bewilling to read it. If they shut their brains off in paragraph twobecause the document sounds legal and threatening, you lose. You alsolose if they decide that you think they're stupid, or if they decidethat you don't care. Don't get so informal that you seem condescendingor sloppy. If necessary, get a technical writer to clean up thepunctuation and spelling.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S3-4">11.1.1.4 Enforcement authority</A></H4><PCLASS="para">Writing down the policy is not the point; living by it is. That meansthat when the policy isn't followed, something should happen to fix it.Somebody needs to be responsible for making those corrections happen,and the policy needs to specify who that's going to be and the generalrange of corrections. Here are some examples of what a security policymight specify:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Managers of certain services have the authority to revoke access.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Managers will be asked to take care of some kinds oftransgressions.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Facilities that don't meet certain standards may be cut off from thecorporate network and external access by the people who run thecorporate network.</P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">The policy should specify who is going to decide and give someindication of what kinds of penalties are available to them. Itshould not specify exactly what will happen when; it's a policy, not amandatory sentencing law. </P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S3-5">11.1.1.5 Provision for reviews</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-20982"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-20984"></A>You can't expect to set a policy up once and forget it. The needs ofyour site will change over time, and policies that were perfectlysensible may become either too restrictive or too lax. Sometimeschange is obvious: if you work for a startup company that goes fromsix people to 6,000 people, it will probably occur to you that thingsare different in important ways (but you still may not get around toredoing the security policy if you didn't set up a mechanism for thatin advance). If you work for a 200-year old university, however, youmay not expect much change. However, even if the organization appearsto be doing its best to fossilize, the computers change, the externalnetworks change, and new people come in to replace ones who leave. Youstill need to review and change your policies on a regular basis.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S3-6">11.1.1.6 Discussion of specific security issues</A></H4><PCLASS="para">Because of the differences between organizations, it's hard to bespecific about issues without writing an entire book just about securitypolicies.

It'smuch more useful to have a one-page document that describes&quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot; in terms that everyone in yourorganization can understand, than a 100-page document that describes&quot;how,&quot; but that nobody except your most senior technicalstaff can understand. </P><PCLASS="para">For example, consider a policy that includes a requirement that says: </P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="blockquote"><PCLASS="para">Nonreusable passwords shall be used to authenticate all incomingconnections from the outside world, in order to prevent potentialattackers from being able to capture reusable passwords by monitoringsuch connections.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">This requirement is much more useful than a policy that says:</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="blockquote"><PCLASS="para">S/Key will be used for all incoming connections.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Why? Because the first policy describes <EMCLASS="emphasis">what</EM> is tobe protected and <EMCLASS="emphasis">why</EM>, and it leaves<EMCLASS="emphasis">how</EM> open so the technical staff can select the bestimplementation. </P><PCLASS="para"> A policy that says the following is better yet:</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="blockquote"><PCLASS="para">Regular passwords are often stolen and reused when they pass acrossnetworks. We won't use passwords that can be reused across networks ourcompany doesn't control.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">This policy communicates the same information without the legal-stylelanguage. It also clarifies some other points. For example, in theoriginal language does the &quot;outside world&quot; include companiesthat have special relationships with yours? It may seem obvious to youthat it does, but it probably doesn't seem obvious to the managers whoare arranging to work with those companies. The reworded language makesit clear what the criterion is (although you may still end up arguingabout what networks meet it). </P><PCLASS="para">Policy can guide you in selecting and implementing technology, but itshouldn't be used to specify it.
