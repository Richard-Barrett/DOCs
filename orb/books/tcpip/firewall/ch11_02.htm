If you've beenadministering a site or making any decisions about security, you'vebeen enforcing an internal theory about securiy, even if you've neverarticulated it. You're going to need to come to a clear and explicitunderstanding of what that internal policy is before you can discusspolicy issues with other people in order to produce a written policy foryour site.</P><PCLASS="para">With that in mind, look at the decisions you've made about security anddecide what you think your site's security goals should be. That may notbe the policy that your site ends up with, but it's an important firststep.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S2-4">11.2.2 What Is Your Site's Security Policy?</A></H3><PCLASS="para">The second step towards putting together a working security policy foryour site is to determine what everybody else's security policy is. Whatdo the users and managers expect security to do for them? What do theythink of the way security is handled currently? What are other computerfacilities doing and why? </P><PCLASS="para">Every site has at least one security policy. The problem is that mostsites have more than one; perhaps as many as there are people involvedwith the site's computers. Sometimes this proliferation of policies ispurely unconscious; different computer facilities within the same sitemay be doing radically different things without even realizing it.Sometimes it's an open secret; administrators may be trying to maintaina security policy that they believe is necessary, even though the userpopulation does not agree with them. Sometimes it's out-and-out war.Generally, people think of universities as the main place where computerusers and computer administrators are engaged in open security warfare,but in fact many companies spend large amounts of time fighting aboutsecurity issues (for example, administration and the engineers are oftenat odds).</P><PCLASS="para">Some of the security policies for a site may be written down already,but most are likely to be implicit and unpublicized. The onlyway to find out about them is to go and ask. Be sure to ask managers,system administrators, and users. Then look at the actual computers andsee what's really going on. It's unlikely that anybody willactually lie to you. However, they may be tellingyou what they think is going on, or what they wish was going on, or whatthey know is supposed to be going on, instead of reporting the actual state ofaffairs. </P><PCLASS="para">Managers who are used to dealing with computers that have been securedmay believe that computers are automatically secure; the shippedconfiguration will be reasonably safe if it is connected to a network.This is not true. In fact, the truth is almost the exact opposite. Thedefault configuration that machines are shipped with is usuallylaughably insecure, and it requires considerable expertise to arrive ata secure configuration. Therefore, a manager who says that all of thecomputers are perfectly secure may be completely incorrect, withouthaving the least intention of deceiving you.</P><PCLASS="para">If you ask questions that have clear &quot;right&quot; answers, mostpeople will tend to try to give you those answers. Other people willbecome defensive. Try to ask neutral questions that don't have a clearbias. For example, don't ask people if they think security is important;instead, ask which is more important to them, security or a cooperativework environment, and then get them to expand on that answer. </P><PCLASS="para">When you talk to people, make it extremely clear why you're asking.Asking about security policies tends to give people the impression thatyou're trying to check up on them. Some people will try to get a goodgrade, rather than discussing reality. Others will become hostile(after all, why should you be checking up on them?). If you get either ofthese reactions, stop asking questions about security policies (there'sno point in it if they're not going to give useful answers), and go backto trying to explain what you're doing and why. If they never believeyou, ask somebody else.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S2-5">11.2.3 External Factors That InfluenceSecurity Policies</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21073"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21076"></A>Your site isn't completely independent. There are issues outside of acomputer facility that influence security policy. These include legalrequirements, contractual obligations, and existing organizationalpolicies.</P><PCLASS="para">Let's look first at legal issues. In the United States, apublicly traded company has a legal responsibility to its shareholdersto protect its assets. This means that if you work for such a company,even if everybody at the company agrees that you ought to remove all ofthe passwords and let the Internet in, you can't choose that as asecurity policy. Your security policy must show evidence that you aresafeguarding the company's computers and information. What's required is&quot;due diligence,&quot; an attempt in good faith to take normalprecautions. &quot;Normal precautions&quot; limit what you need todo; you don't have a legal responsibility to require retinal scansbefore people can touch the computers!</P><PCLASS="para">Regardless of the type of institution you work for, in most places inthe United States there is also a legal responsibility to safeguardcertain types of information about employees. Employee reviews aregenerally legally protected; so are straightforward personnel records ofinformation like home addresses.  Universities have legalresponsibilities regarding the safeguarding of student records, rightdown to the information about which students attend the university. Dataabout individuals has even more legal protection in some Europeancountries. If you do not work for Human Resources or Student Records,you may think you don't have to worry about protecting this kind ofinformation, but you're probably wrong. Usually, every manager orsupervisor has confidential employee data to deal with; similarly, theinformation used to maintain accounts at universities containsconfidential student data (e.g., whether or not the student isenrolled, and what classes they're taking).</P><PCLASS="para">Your organization may also have contractual obligations to protect data.If you have customer or client data on your systems, your contractsprobably require you to protect it. (This may apply to researchcontracts at universities as well.) If you have source code orprerelease software, you almost certainly have a license that requiresyou to protect it.</P><PCLASS="para">Your organization may also have existing policies that influencesecurity policies. Often, these are policies about the protection ofdata (usually written to meet the many and varied legal obligationsdiscussed above), but there may be policies requiring that people haveaccess to data, especially at universities and public institutions. </P><PCLASS="para">If your organization has a legal department, consult them. (Don'tinvite them to write up a policy; just ask them to explain theinstitution's legal obligations.) If your organization does not have alegal department, consult a senior manager. In any case, find anyexisting written policies and wade through them to see what they saythat's relevant to security. Going through these written policies willalso give you a good idea for what works and doesn't work in a writtenpolicy. If you like the existing policies, base your new ones on them.If you hate the existing policies, resist the temptation to make yournew ones like them just because it's the way it's always been donebefore.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch11_01.htm"TITLE="11.1 Your Security Policy"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 11.1 Your Security Policy"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch11_03.htm"TITLE="11.3 Getting Strategic and Policy Decisions Made"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 11.3 Getting Strategic and Policy Decisions Made"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">11.1 Your Security Policy</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">11.3 Getting Strategic and Policy Decisions Made</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
