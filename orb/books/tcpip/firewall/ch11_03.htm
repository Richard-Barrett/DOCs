If you don'thave top-level management support for security, you aren't going to havesecurity; it's that simple. Why wouldn't you have supportfrom top-level managers? Probably because you haven't addressed theirconcerns in ways they understand. Here are some things to consider inmaking your case.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S2-6">11.3.1 Involve Everybody Who's Affected</A></H3><PCLASS="para">You may be the person with the best understanding of the technicalissues, but you aren't necessarily the person with the bestunderstanding of the institution's needs as a whole. Strategic andpolicy decisions must be made by people working together. You can't justcome up with a policy you like, take it around to a lot of people, andhave them rubber stamp it. Even if you manage to get them to doit&nbsp;- which may well be more difficult than getting them to help makeintelligent decisions&nbsp;- they won't actually follow it.</P><PCLASS="para">One major computer manufacturer had a policy forbidding dial-in modems.Unfortunately, the company's centralized dial-in access didn't satisfyall of their programmers. Some of these programmers figured out that,although they couldn't request modem lines, they could redirect existingfax lines to modems, go home at night, and dial up their work computers.Even more unfortunately, a programmer in one of the groups with thishabit was fired and proceeded to break into the site. He systematicallytried all the phone numbers in the range the company had assigned to faxmachines until he connected to one of the redirected ones and got alogin prompt from an unsecured machine inside the corporate firewall.The former employee did significant damage before he was detected andshut out. He was able to gain a lot of time because the people trying toshut him out didn't know the modems existed. When they did figureout that modems were involved, the process of getting rid of them allproved to be tedious and prolonged, because lines were diverted onlywhen people planned to use them. </P><PCLASS="para">That whole incident was the result of the fact that management andsystem administrators had a policy that ignored some genuine needs ofthe people using the computer facility. The official policy requireddial-in access to be so secure it was almost completely unusable,and the unofficial policy required dial-in access to be so usable thatit was almost completely insecure. If there had been a policy thatallowed moderately insecure dial-in access, the break-in might have beenavoided, and it certainly would have been easier to detect and stop. Itwould also have been avoided if the programmers had agreed that securitywas more important than dial-in access, but that kind of agreement ismuch harder to achieve than a compromise.</P><PCLASS="para">In fact, in this case there wasn't much actual disagreement betweenthe parties involved. If the managers had been asked, they would havesaid that letting people work from home was important to them; theydidn't understand that the existing dial-in system was not providingacceptable service. If the programmers had been asked, they would havesaid that preventing people from maliciously deleting their work wasimportant to them; they didn't understand the risks of what they weredoing. But nobody thought about security and usability at the sametime, and the result was pure disaster.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S2-7">11.3.2 Accept `Wrong' Decisions</A></H3><PCLASS="para">You may find that the security policy you come up with is one youdon't particularly like. If this happens because the people who made itdon't understand what they've done, then you should fight strongly toget it fixed. If, on the other hand, people understand the risks, butthey don't share your priorities, put your objections down in writingand go ahead with the policies. Yes, this will sometimes lead todisasters. Nonetheless, if you ask a group to make a decision, you can'tinsist that it be your decision. You also can't be sure that your way isthe only right way.</P><PCLASS="para">Sometimes managers have a genuine willingness to accept risks that seemoverwhelming to system administrators. For example, one computermanufacturer chose to put one of their large and powerful machines on anunprotected net, and to give out accounts on the machine to customersand prospective customers upon request. The system administrator thoughtthis was a terrible idea and pointed out that the machine wasfundamentally impossible to secure; there were a large number ofaccounts, changing rapidly, with no pattern, and they belonged to peoplethe company couldn't control. Furthermore, the reason the company wasgiving out test accounts was that the machine was a fastparallel processor, which also meant that it might as well have beendesigned as the ultimate password-cracking machine. To the systemadministrator, it seemed extremely likely that once this machine wasbroken into (which was probably inevitable), it was going to be used asa tool to break into other machines. </P><PCLASS="para">A battle ensued, and eventually, a compromise was reached. The machinewas made available, but extra security was employed to protect internalnetworks from it. (This was a compromise because it interfered withemployees' abilities to use the machine, which they needed todo to assist the outsiders who were using it.) Management chose toaccept the remaining risk that the machine would be used as a platformto attack other sites, knowing that there was a potential for extremelybad publicity as a result.</P><PCLASS="para">What happened? Sure enough, the machine <EMCLASS="emphasis">was</EM> compromised, and was used to attack at least the internalnetworks. The attacks on the internal networks were extremely annoying,and cost the company money in system administrators' time, but theydidn't produce significant damage, and there was little or no badpublicity. Management considered this expense to be acceptable,however, given the sales generated by letting people test-drive themachine. In this case, conflicting security policies were resolvedexplicitly&nbsp;- by discussion and compromise&nbsp;- and the result was apolicy that seemed less strong than the original, but that providedsufficient protection. By openly and intentionally choosing to accept arisk, the company brought it within acceptable limits. </P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S2-8">11.3.3 Present Risks and Benefits inDifferent Ways for Different People</A></H3><PCLASS="para">You need to recognize that different people have different concerns.Mostly, these concerns are predictable from their positions, but someare personal. For example, suppose that:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Your chief financial officer is concerned about the cost ofsecurity, or the cost of not having enough security. </P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Your chief executive officer is concerned about the negativepublicity a security incident involving your site could bring, orabout potential loss or theft of intellectual property via the Internet. </P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">A department chair is concerned that tenure reviews will berevealed.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">A mid-level manager is concerned his employees aresquandering all their time reading Usenet news or surfing the Web. </P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Another mid-level manager is concerned her employees areimporting virus-infected <SPANCLASS="acronym">PC</SPAN> software from the Internet. </P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Still another mid-level manager is concerned how best toprovide technical support to customers over the Internet. </P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">A professor is concerned her data won't be accessiblefrom other institutions while she's on sabbatical.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">An instructor is concerned that students are stealing answersfrom each other or tests from instructors.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Users are concerned about the availability of Internet servicesthey feel are vital for their jobs. </P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Users are concerned they won't be able to work togetherif there are too many security issues.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Students are concerned they won't be able to play with thecomputers, which is a part of how they learn.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Graduate students and project managers are concerned thatsecurity measures are going to slow down projects with stricttimelines.</P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">You need to take the time to discover all of these different, legitimateconcerns and address them. You may also decide there are thingsthat these various people <EMCLASS="emphasis">should</EM> be worried about,but aren't, because they don't know any better; you have to educatethem about those issues. This means you need to take the time tounderstand their jobs, what they want to accomplish with the network,and how well they appreciate the security issues.</P><PCLASS="para">Talk to each of these people in terms they care about.This requires a lot of listening before you ever start talking. Tomanagers, talk about things like probable costs and potentiallosses; to executives, talk about risk versus benefit; and totechnical staff, talk about capabilities. Before you go in with aproposal, be prepared with an explanation that suits your audience'spoint of view and technical level. If you have trouble understanding orcommunicating with a particular group, you may find it helps tobuild a relationship with someone who understands that group and cantranslate for you.</P><PCLASS="para">You're not trying to deceive anybody. The basic information is thesame, no matter who you're talking to. On the other hand, if aparticular decision saves money and makes for a more enjoyableworking environment, you don't go to the chief financial officer and say&quot;We want to do it this way because it's more fun,&quot; and thengo the programmers and say &quot;We want to do it this way because it'scheaper.&quot;</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S2-9">11.3.4 Avoid Surprises</A></H3><PCLASS="para">When it comes to security, nobody likes surprises. That's why you needto make sure that the relevant people understand the relevant issuesand are aware of, and agree with (or at least agree to abide by), thedecisions made concerning those issues.</P><PCLASS="para">In particular, people need to know about the consequences of theirdecisions, including best, worst, and probable outcomes. Consequencesthat are obvious to you may not be obvious to other people. Forexample, people who are not extremely<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>-knowledgeable may be quite willing to give outroot passwords. They don't realize what the implications are, and theymay be very upset when they find out.</P><PCLASS="para">People who have been surprised often overreact. They may go fromcompletely unconcerned to demanding the impossible. One good break-in,or even a prank, can convert people from not understanding all the fussabout passwords to inquiring about the availability of voiceprintidentification and machine gun turrets. (It's preferable to get them tomake decisions while they are mildly worried, instead of blindlypanicked!)<BCLASS="emphasis.bold"></B></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S2-10">11.3.5 Condense to Important Decisions, withImplications</A></H3><PCLASS="para">When you're asking a top manager to decide issues of policy, presentonly the decision to be made and the pros, cons, and implications ofthe various options: not a lot of extraneous decisions. For example,you shouldn't waste your <SPANCLASS="acronym">CEO</SPAN>'s time by asking himor her to decide whether you should run Sendmail or<SPANCLASS="acronym">SMAIL</SPAN> as your mailer; that's primarily a technicalissue, and one that should be resolved by the relevant technical staffand managers. On the other hand, you may need to call upon your<SPANCLASS="acronym">CEO</SPAN> to decide strategic issues regarding mail, suchas whether or not everyone in the organization is to have emailaccess, or only certain people (and if it's to be limited, to whom).</P><PCLASS="para">Don't offer people decisions unless they have both the authority and theinformation with which to make those decisions. Always make it clear whythey're being asked to decide (instead of having the decision madesomewhere else). In most cases, you want to avoid open-ended questions. It's better to ask &quot;Should we invest money in a single place tobe a defense, or should we try to protect all the machines?&quot; than&quot;What do you think we should do about Internet security?&quot;(The open question gives the replier the option of saying&quot;nothing,&quot; which is probably not an answer you're going tobe happy with.)</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S2-11">11.3.6 Justify Everything Else in Terms ofThose Decisions</A></H3><PCLASS="para">All of the technical and implementation decisions you make should followfrom the high-level guidance you've obtained from your top managers andexecutives. If you don't see which way you should go with a technicalissue because it depends on nontechnical issues, you may need torequest more guidance on that issue. Again, explain clearly theproblem; the options; and the pros, cons, and implications of eachoption.</P><PCLASS="para">When you explain policies or procedures, explain them in terms of theoriginal decisions. Show people the reasoning process.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S2-12">11.3.7 Emphasize that Many Issues AreManagement and Personnel Issues, not Technical Issues</A></H3><PCLASS="para">Certain problems, which some people try to characterize or solve astechnical problems, are really management or personnel problems. Forexample, some managers worry that their employees will spend all theirtime at work reading Usenet news or surfing the Web. However, this isnot a technical problem, but a personnel problem: the onlineequivalent of employees spending the day at their desks reading thenewspaper or doing crossword puzzles. </P><PCLASS="para">Another common example of misdirected concern involves managers worryingthat employees will distribute confidential information over theInternet. Again, this usually isn't a technical problem; it's amanagement problem. The same employee who could email your source codeto a competitor could also carry it out the door in his pocket on an 8mmtape (generally far more conveniently and with less chance of beingcaught). It is irrational to place technological restrictions oninformation that can be sent out by email unless you also checkeverybody's bags and pockets as they leave the premises.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-11-S2-13">11.3.8 Don't Assume That Anything IsObvious</A></H3><PCLASS="para">Certain things that seem obvious to a technical person who isinterested in security may not be at all obvious to nontechnicalmanagers and executives. As we've mentioned, it's obvious to anyonewho understands <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> that packet filtering will allowyou to restrict access to services by <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> addresses,but not by user (unless you can tie specific users to specific<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> addresses). Why? Because &quot;user&quot; isnot a concept in <SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>, and there's nothing in the<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> packet that reflects what &quot;user&quot; isresponsible for that packet. Conversely, certain things that seemobvious to managers and executives are not at all obvious to technicalstaff, e.g., that the public's perception (which is oftenincomplete or simply incorrect) of a problem at your company is oftenmore important than the technical &quot;truth&quot; of the matter.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch11_02.htm"TITLE="11.2 Putting Together a Security Policy "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 11.2 Putting Together a Security Policy "BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch11_04.htm"TITLE="11.4 What If You Can't Get a Security Policy?"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 11.4 What If You Can't Get a Security Policy?"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">11.2 Putting Together a Security Policy </TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">11.4 What If You Can't Get a Security Policy?</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
