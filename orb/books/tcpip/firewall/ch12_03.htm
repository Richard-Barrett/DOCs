You obviously need to keep your system up to date, but beforeyou can do that, you need to keep yourself up to date.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-12-S2-9">12.3.1 Keeping Yourself Up to Date</A></H3><PCLASS="para">The hardest part of firewall maintenance is staying abreast of thecontinuous developments in the field. New things are happening everyday; new bugs are being discovered and exploited; new attacks are beingcarried out; new patches and fixes for your existing systems and toolsare being made available; and new tools are becoming available. Stayingup to date with all these changes can easily be the most time-consumingpart of a firewall maintainer's job.</P><PCLASS="para">How do you stay up to date? Well, primarily by staying involved. Finda set of mailing lists, newsgroups, magazines, and professional forumsyou feel comfortable with and follow them carefully. Thissection describes the most important ways you can keep involved. <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appa_01.htm"TITLE="Resources">Appendix A</A> provides a more complete list, along withcontact information.</P><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-12-S3-1">12.3.1.1 Mailing lists</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21518"></A>There are several mailing lists that might be of interest to anyonewho maintains a firewall; instructions for subscribing to these areincluded in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appa_01.htm"TITLE="Resources">Appendix A</A>. The most important list forfolks interested in firewalls is the Firewalls mailing list at<EMCLASS="emphasis">greatcircle.com</EM>. This list hosts discussions ofthe design, installation, configuration, maintenance, and philosophyof Internet firewalls of all types. The main drawback of the list isthat it can be very busy; there are sometimes more than100 messages per day posted to the list. To address the problem ofvolume, a Firewalls-Digest version of the list is also available;Firewalls-Digest subscribers receive all of the same messages thatsubscribers to the main Firewalls list receive, but the messages arebundled into &quot;digest&quot; format (there are usually 10 to 20messages per digest).</P><PCLASS="para">Another list you should almost certainly subscribe to is the<SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT</SPAN>-Advisory mailing list. This is the list towhich <SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN> posts its new security advisories.If you are served by a response team other thanC<SPANCLASS="acronym">ERT-CC</SPAN> (e.g., one of the other teams in the<SPANCLASS="acronym">FIRST</SPAN>, described in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appa_01.htm"TITLE="Resources">Appendix A</A>),check to see if that team has its own advisory list and subscribe tothat one as well as to the <SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN> list. Your teamwill probably mirror most of <SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN>'s advisories,and may produce advisories of its own that are relevant to itsconstituency (you) that aren't mirrored by <SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN>.</P><PCLASS="para">Beyond the Firewalls and <SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT</SPAN>-Advisory mailinglists, the choices are less clear. There are several geographic orindustry-specific firewalls lists, e.g., the Academic-Firewalls andFirewalls-<SPANCLASS="acronym">UK</SPAN> lists. There is also a mailing listcalled Bugtraq, where detailed discussions of network security holestake place; if you can wade through the seemingly perpetual flamewars, you can occasionally find some gems there.</P><PCLASS="para">There are also product- and package-specific lists for many firewallsproducts and packages; for example, there are lists for Livingston,Telebit, and Cisco routers, Morning Star software, and the<SPANCLASS="acronym">TIS FWTK</SPAN>. If you are using (or contemplating using)a particular product or package, you should probably subscribe to thelist for that product or package, if there is one. Lists of this kindare often an invaluable source of technical support, particularlyduring widespread security incidents.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-12-S3-2">12.3.1.2 Newsgroups</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21540"></A>In addition to the various mailing lists you might subscribe to, thereare a variety of newsgroups that are directly or indirectly relevantto firewalls. Many of these parallel the mailing lists mentioned inthe previous section. For example, <SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN>advisories are posted to the<EMCLASS="emphasis">comp.security.announce</EM> group, and there arenewsgroups for a variety of commercial and noncommercial networkproducts. There has been talk of creating a firewalls newsgroup(probably <EMCLASS="emphasis">comp.security.firewalls</EM>, or perhaps a pair ofrelated newsgroups: <EMCLASS="emphasis">comp.security.firewalls.misc</EM>and <EMCLASS="emphasis">comp.security.firewalls.announce</EM>), whichwould be completely independent of the Firewalls mailing listdiscussed above.[3]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[3] This may or may not have happened by the time you read this.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-12-S3-3">12.3.1.3 Magazines</A></H4><PCLASS="para">Many trade magazines are beginning to include occasional or regularfeatures on firewalls, although there isn't yet an entire magazinedevoted to Internet security. (However, it's probably just a matter oftime before one appears.) At this point, none of the magazines standhead and shoulders above the rest in terms of their coverage offirewalls. One thing to keep in mind about magazines (even tabloidweeklies like <EMCLASS="emphasis">Network World</EM> and<EMCLASS="emphasis">MacWeek</EM>) is their lead time; you often hear aboutsomething on the Net&nbsp;- on the various mailing lists and newsgroupsdiscussed above&nbsp;- weeks before it appears in the trade press.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-12-S3-4">12.3.1.4 Professional forums</A></H4><PCLASS="para">There are many professional forums available for your participation.These include conferences, vendor user groups, local user groups,professional societies (such as <SPANCLASS="acronym">IEEE</SPAN> and<SPANCLASS="acronym">ACM</SPAN> special interest groups), and so on. Manypeople find attending these events invaluable, not so much for theformal programs presented, but for the contacts they make with otherpeople who have solved problems similar to those they are currentlyfacing.</P><PCLASS="para">At this point, one of the best conferences for Internet firewallbuilders and maintainers is the <SPANCLASS="acronym">USENIX</SPAN> SecuritySymposium (generally held annually). If you are a<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> system administrator, then one of the bestpossible ways you can spend a week each year is at the <SPANCLASS="acronym">USENIX LISA</SPAN> conference.[4] You can find more information about both of these conferences andabout <SPANCLASS="acronym">USENIX</SPAN> in general in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appa_01.htm"TITLE="Resources">Appendix A</A>.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[4] <SPANCLASS="acronym">LISA</SPAN> used to mean&quot;Large Installation System Administration,&quot; back in thedays when a large installation meant having more than a dozenmachines; today, most sites would qualify under that definition, andthe focus of the conference has widened to include all types of<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> system administration, but the name liveson.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Local user and special interest groups are also a great way to keep intouch between conferences; most meet monthly or bimonthly.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-12-S2-10">12.3.2 Keeping Your Systems Up To Date</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21574"></A>If you take care to keep yourself up to date, then keeping yoursystem up to date is a fairly straightforward job. You just need todeal with whatever new problems you hear about, as you hear about them. &#13;</P><PCLASS="para">You should be able to collect enough information from the sourcesdescribed in the previous section to decide whether or not a newproblem is a problem for your site in particular. Beware that you maynot be able to determine instantaneously whether a problem applies toyour site; it may take a few hours or days for the information youneed to become available to you. You may need to make a judgment callabout what to do about a particular problem in the absence of solidinformation, with only vague reports about the problem and itsconsequences to go on. Which way you err&nbsp;- towards caution orconvenience&nbsp;- is going to be dictated by your particularcircumstances. These circumstances include the potential probleminvolved, what you can realistically do about it, how much your sitecares about security versus availability and convenience, and so on.Caution would dictate blocking the problem if it's at all possiblethat it applies to you. Convenience, on the other hand, would dictatewaiting to take action until you're fairly sure that the problem doesapply to you.</P><PCLASS="para">There are a couple of principles to keep in mind when you are decidingwhat fixes to apply and when.<DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Don't be in a hurry to upgrade</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Don't be in too big a hurry to install a patch or a fix unless you havereason to believe that the problem is being, or could be, exploitedagainst you. It's always better to let somebody else go first, todiscover what new problems the patch or fix creates. We're notsuggesting you should delay very long in installing a relevantpatch, but it's often wise to wait at least a few hours or a couple ofdays to see if the patch blows up on anybody else.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Don't patch problems you don't have</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21590"></A>You don't want to apply patches for problems you don't have. If you doapply patches in this way, you run a great risk of introducing newproblems. If a patch applies only to a particular piece of software ora particular release, and you don't use that software or that release,don't install the patch. If it applies to features that you don't usein programs that you do use, apply it anyway; you may start using thefeatures in the future, and at that point you won't remember whether ornot you patched it.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Beware of interdependent patches</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">While you generally shouldn't apply patches for problems you don't have,be aware that patches for problems you do have may depend on previouspatches for problems you don't have. With any luck, the documentationfor the patch you want to apply says what other patches (if any) areprerequisites, but this isn't always the case. Sometimes you just haveto make your best guess. Situations like this are where it really helpsto be tied in to the support mailing lists and newsgroups concerningyour platform; you can ask there and see if anybody else has alreadyfigured this out.</P></DD></DL></P></DIV><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21597"></A></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch12_02.htm"TITLE="12.2 Monitoring Your System"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 12.2 Monitoring Your System"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch12_04.htm"TITLE="12.4 How Long Does It Take?"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 12.4 How Long Does It Take?"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">12.2 Monitoring Your System</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">12.4 How Long Does It Take?</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
