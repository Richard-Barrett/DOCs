Obviously, this isn't a great approach.You need a plan for how you're going to respond to a computer securityincident at your site, and you need to develop that plan well beforean incident occurs.</P><PCLASS="para">There isn't room here to detail everything you need to know todeal with a security incident: attacks are many and varied; they changeconstantly; and responding to them can involve a Byzantine assortment oflegal and technical issues. This chapter is intended to give you anoutline of the issues involved, and the practical steps you can takeahead of time to smooth the process. <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appa_01.htm"TITLE="Resources">Appendix A, <CITECLASS="appendix">Resources</CITE></A> providesa list of resources that may provide additional help.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S1-1">13.1 Responding to an Incident</A></H2><PCLASS="para">This section discusses a number of steps you'll need to take whenyou respond to a security incident. You won't necessarily need tofollow these steps in the order they're given, and not all of thesesteps are appropriate for all incidents. But, we recommend that you atleast contemplate each of them when you find yourself dealing with anincident.</P><PCLASS="para">In the section called &quot;Planning Your Response,&quot; later inthis chapter, we'll look again at each of these rules and help youfigure out how to work them into the overall response plan that youshould develop before an incident actually occurs.</P><DIVCLASS="sidebar"><H4CLASS="sidebar"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-21641">Rules for Incident Response</A></H4><PCLASS="para">In their book <EMCLASS="emphasis">Practical UNIX Security</EM>, SimsonGarfinkel and Gene Spafford provide two excellent, overriding rulesfor incident response. Keep these rules in mind as you read thischapter and during any real-life incident response.<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Rule 1: Don't Panic!</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Rule 2: Document!</P></LI></UL></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S2-1">13.1.1 Evaluate the Situation</A></H3><PCLASS="para">The first step in responding to a security incident is to decide whatresponse, if any, needs to be made immediately. Ask these questions:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Has an attacker succeeded in getting into your systems? If so, youhave a genuine emergency on your hands, whether or not the attacker iscurrently active.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Is the attack currently in progress? If so, you need to decide howyou're going to react right now. If the attack isn't currently inprogress, you may not be in such a hurry.</P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">If the incident looks like an aggressive attack on your system, youprobably want to take strong steps quickly. These steps might includeshutting down the system or your Internet connection until you figureout how to deal with the situation. </P><PCLASS="para">On the other hand, if the incident is a less aggressive one&nbsp;- perhapssomeone has just opened a Telnet connection to your machine and istrying various login/password pairs&nbsp;- then you may want to move moreslowly. If you're reasonably confident that the attack won't succeed(e.g., you can see that the attacker is trying passwords thatconsist of all lower-case letters, and you know for certain that noaccount on the system has such a password), you might want to leavethings alone and just watch for a while to see what the attacker does. This may give you an opportunity to trace the attack. (However, see thesection below called &quot;Pursuing and Capturing the Intruder&quot;for a discussion of the issues involved in tracing an attack.) </P><PCLASS="para">Whatever you do, remember Rule 1: Don't Panic!</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S2-2">13.1.2 Disconnect or Shut Down, asAppropriate</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21664"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21666"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21669"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21672"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21675"></A>Once you've evaluated the situation, your next priority is to giveyourself the time to respond without risking your systems further. Theleast disruptive alternative is usually to disconnect the affectedmachine from all networks; this will shut down any active connections. Shutting down active connections may make it harder to trace theintruder, but it will allow the rest of the people at your site tocontinue to do their work, and it will leave the intruder's programsrunning. This may help you to identify who the intruder might be.</P><PCLASS="para">If you're afraid that other machines have been compromised or arevulnerable to the same attack, you'll probably want to disconnect asmany machines as you can as a unit. This may mean taking down yourconnection to the Internet, if possible. If your Internet connection ismanaged elsewhere in your organization, you may need to detach just yourportion of the network, but you'll also need to talk to other parts ofyour organization as soon as possible to let them know what's happening.</P><PCLASS="para">In some situations, you may want to shut down the compromised system.However, this should be a last resort for a number of reasons: <ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">It destroys information you may need.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">You won't be able to analyze or fix the machine while it's down; you'll have to disconnect it from the network eventually anyway to bring it back up again.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">It's even more disruptive to legitimate users than removing thenetwork connection.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">It protects only one machine at a time. (It's much easier tocleanly disconnect a set of systems than to cleanly shut them down.)</P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">Even if you're responding to an incident that has already ended, youstill might want to disconnect or shut down the system, or at leastclose it to users, while you analyze what happened and make any changesnecessary to keep it from happening again. This will keep you from beingconfused by things users are doing, and it will prevent the intruderfrom returning before you're done.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S2-3">13.1.3 Analyze and Respond</A></H3><PCLASS="para">Your next priority is to start to fix what's gone wrong. The first stepin actually correcting the problem is to relax, think for a while, andmake sure you really understand what's happening and what you're dealingwith. The last thing you want to do is make the situation worse bydoing something rash and ill-considered. Whatever corrective actionsyou're contemplating, think them through carefully. Will they reallysolve the problem? Will they, in turn, cause other problems?</P><PCLASS="para">When you're working in an unusual, high-stress situation like this,the chances of making a major error go way up. Because you're probablygoing to be working with system privileges (for example, working asroot on a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> system), the consequences of anerror could be serious.</P><PCLASS="para">There are several ways you can reduce the chances of making an error. One good way is to work with a partner; each of you can check theother's commands after they're typed but before they're executed. Evenif you're working alone, many people find that reading commands aloudand checking the arguments in reverse order before executing them helpsavoid mistakes. Resist the temptation to try to work fast. You will gohome sooner if you work slowly and carefully.</P><PCLASS="para">Try not to let your users get in the way of your response. You may wantto give someone the specific job of dealing with user inquiries so therest of your response team can concentrate on responding to theincident.</P><PCLASS="para">Also, try to keep your responders from tripping over each other. Makeit clear which system managers and investigators are working on whichtask, so they won't step on each other's toes (or wind upunintentionally chasing each other as part of the investigation!).</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S2-4">13.1.4 Make `Incident in Progress'Notifications</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21700"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21702"></A>You're not the only person who needs to know what's going on.

At the veryleast, let them know that you are busy responding to an incident, andthat you may not be available to them for other matters. Usually, they needto know why they're being inconvenienced and what they should do tospeed recovery (even if the only thing they can do is to go away andleave you alone).</P><PCLASS="para">Depending on the nature of your site and the incident in question, youmay also need to inform your legal, audit, public relations, andsecurity departments. </P><PCLASS="para">If there are multiple computer facilities at your site, you'll need toinform the other facilities as soon as possible; they are likelysources and future targets for similar attacks.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S3-2">13.1.4.2 CERT-CC or other incident responseteams</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21713"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21715"></A>If your organization is served by an incident response team such as<SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN>, or has its own such team, letthem know what's going on and try to enlist their aid. (Forinstructions on how to contact <SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN> or anotherresponse team, see <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appa_01.htm"TITLE="Resources">Appendix A</A>.) What steps responseteams can take to help you will depend on the charter and resources ofthe response team. Even if they can't help you directly, they can tellyou whether the attack on your site looks as if it is part of a largerpattern of incidents. In that case, they may be able to coordinateyour response with the responses of other sites.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S3-3">13.1.4.3 Vendors and service providers</A></H4><PCLASS="para">You might want to get in touch with your vendor support contacts or your<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21724"></A>Internet service provider(s), if you think they might be able to help orshould be aware of the situation. For example, if the attackers appearto be exploiting an operating system bug, you should probably contactthe vendor to see if they know about it and have a fix for it. At thevery least, they'll be able to warn other sites about the bug.Similarly, your Internet provider is unlikely to be able to do muchabout your immediate problem, but they may be able to warn othercustomers. There is also a possibility that your Internet provider hasitself been compromised, in which case they need to know immediately. Your vendors and service provider may have special contacts orprocedures for security incidents that will yield much faster resultsthan going through normal support channels.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S3-4">13.1.4.4 Other sites</A></H4><PCLASS="para">Finally, if the incident appears to involve other sites&nbsp;- that is, ifthe attack appears to be coming from a particular site, or if it looksas if the attackers have gone after that site after breaking intoyours&nbsp;- you should inform those other sites. These sites are usuallyeasy to identify as the sources or destinations of connections. It'soften much harder to figure out how to find an actual human being withsome responsibility for the computer in question, who is awake andreachable, and has a common language with you.</P><PCLASS="para">If you don't know who to inform, talk to your response team (or<SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN>). They will probably either know or knowhow to find out, and they have experience in calling strangers to tellthem they have security problems.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S2-5">13.1.5 Snapshot the System</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21735"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21738"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21740"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21743"></A>Another early step to take is to make a &quot;snapshot&quot; of eachcompromised system. You might do this by doing a full backup to tape,or by copying the whole system to another disk. In the latter case, ifyour site maintains its own spare parts inventory, you might considerusing one of the spares for this purpose, instead of a disk that isalready in use and might itself turn out to have been compromised. </P><PCLASS="para">The snapshot is important for several reasons:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If you misdiagnose the problem or blow the recovery, you canalways get back to the time of the snapshot.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">The snapshot may be vital for investigative and legalproceedings.

Here are some guidelines:[1]<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Uniquely identify (label) the snapshot media, and put the date, time,your name, and your signature on it.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Write-protect the media&nbsp;- permanently, if possible.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Safeguard the media against tampering (for example, put it in a lockedcontainer) so that if and when you hand it over to law-enforcement orother authorities, you can tell them whose custody the media has beenin, and why you're certain it hasn't been tampered with since it wasfirst created.</P></LI></UL></P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] See <EMCLASS="emphasis">Computer Crime: A Crimefighter's Handbook</EM>,by David Icove, Karl Seger, and William VonStorch (O'Reilly &amp;Associates, 1995), for a detailed discussion of labeling and protectingevidence.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">It's a good idea to set aside an adequate supply of fresh media just forsnapshots, because you never know when you're going to need to produceone.

It depends on the circumstances. Here are somepossibilities:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If the attacker didn't succeed in compromising your system, youmay not need to do much. You may decide not to bother reacting tocasual attempts. You may also find that your incident was actuallysomething perfectly innocent, and you don't need to do anything at all.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If the attack was a particularly determined one, you may want toincrease your monitoring (at least temporarily), and you'll probablywant to inform other people to watch out for future attempts. </P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21784"></A>If the attacker became an intruder, that is, he actually managedto get into your computers, you're going to need to at least plugthe hole the intruder used, and check to make certain he hasn't damagedanything, or left anything behind.</P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">At worst, you may need to rebuild your system from scratch. Sometimesyou end up doing this because the intruder damaged things, purposefullyor accidentally. More often, you'll rebuild things because it's the onlyway to ensure you have a clean system that hasn't beenbooby-trapped. Most intruders start by making sure they'll be able toget back into your system, even if you close their initial entry point. As a result, your systems may be compromised even if the intruder waspresent only for a short time. </P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="note"><PCLASS="para"><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Always assume that an intruder has created back doors into yoursystem so that he can get back in again easily. This is one of thefirst things many intruders do when they break in to a system.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21791"></A>If you need to rebuild your system, first ensure that your hardware isworking properly. You want to make sure it passes all relevantself-tests and diagnostics; you don't want to restore onto a flakysystem. A reinstall may reveal previously unnoticed hardware problems.For instance, a disk may have bad spots that are in unused files. Whenyou reinstall the operating system, you will attempt to write over thebad parts and the problem will suddenly become apparent. </P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21795"></A>Next, make sure you are using trusted media and programs, notnecessarily your last backup, to restore the system. Unless you areabsolutely sure that you can accurately date the first time theintruder accessed your system, you don't know whether or not programshad already been modified at the time the backups happened. It's oftenbest to rebuild your system from vendor distribution media (that is,the tapes or <SPANCLASS="acronym">CD-ROM</SPAN> your operating system releasecame on), and then reload only user data (not programs that multipleusers share) from your backup tapes.</P><PCLASS="para">If you need programs you didn't get from your vendor (for instance,packages from the Internet), then do one of the following:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Rebuild and reinstall these programs from a trusted backup (oneyou're absolutely positive contains a clean copy). </P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Obtain and install fresh copies from the site you got thepackages from in the first place. </P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">Do not recompile software until you've reinstalled the operatingsystem, including the compiler; you don't know whether the compileritself, and the libraries it depends on, have been compromised.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21807"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21810"></A>This implies that if you're heavily customizing your system orinstalling a lot of extra software beyond what your vendor gives you,you need to work out a way of archiving those customizations andpackages that you're sure can't be tampered with by an attacker. Thisway, you can easily restore those customizations and packages if youneed to. One good way is to make a special backup tape of new softwareimmediately after it's installed and configured, before an attackerhas a chance to modify it.</P><PCLASS="para">You may have programs that were locally written, and in these casesyou may not be able to find even source code that's guaranteed to beuncontaminated. In this situation, someone&nbsp;- preferably the originalauthor&nbsp;- will need to look through the source code. People rarelybother to modify source code, and when they do they aren'tparticularly subtle most of the time. That's because they don't needto be; almost nobody actually bothers to look at the sourcebefore recompiling it.</P><PCLASS="para">In one case, a programmer installed a back door into code he expectedwould run on only one machine, as a personal convenience. The programturned out to be fairly popular and was adopted in a number ofdifferent sites within his university. Years after he wrote it, andlong after the original machine was running a version without the backdoor, he discovered that the back door was still present on all theother sites, despite the fact that it was clearly marked and commentedand within the first page of code. You can't make a comprehensivesearch of a large program, but you can at least avoid humiliation bylooking for obvious changes.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21815"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21816"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21817"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S2-7">13.1.7 Document the Incident</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21821"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21824"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21827"></A>Life gets very confusing when you're discovering, investigating, andrecovering from a security incident. A good chain of communication isimportant in keeping people informed and preventing them from trippingover each other. Keeping a written (either hardcopy or electronic)record of your activities during the incident is also important. Sucha record serves several purposes:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">It can help keep people informed (and thereby help them to resolvethe incident more quickly).</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">It tells you what you did, and when, in responding, so that youcan analyze your response later on (and maybe do better next time).</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">It will be vital if you intend to pursue any legal action. </P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21838"></A>From a legal standpoint, the best records are hardcopy recordsgenerated and identified at the time of occurrence. Just aboutanything else (particularly anything kept online) could be tamperedwith or falsified fairly easily&nbsp;- or at least a judge and jury could beconvinced of that. You need to produce records on pieces of paper,label and date them, and sign them. Furthermore, unless the pages areactually bound together, so that pages can't be inserted or removedwithout indication, you'll need to date and sign every page. (And youthought continuous tractor-feed paper was useless these days!)</P><PCLASS="para">You need to have legal documentation even if you aren't completelycertain you're going to need it. An incident that looks fairly simple tostart with may turn out to be serious.

Another benefit is thatthe pages are usually numbered, so you can determine later on whetherany pages have been removed or added. </P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Terminals running with attached printers or old-fashionedprinting terminals.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">A shell running under the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> <EMCLASS="emphasis">script</EM> command, with the resulting typescript immediately printedand identified.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">A personal-computer terminal program running in&quot;capture&quot; mode, with the resulting typescript immediatelyprinted and identified.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">A microcassette recorder for verbal notes.</P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">You will probably want to use multiple methods, one to record what'shappening online and one to record what's happening outside of thecomputer. For example, you might have a typescript of the commands youwere typing, but a handwritten log for phone calls.</P><PCLASS="para">It's easy to decide what to record online; you simply recordeverything you do. Remember to use the terminal or session that'sbeing recorded. (With some methods, like<EMCLASS="emphasis">script</EM>, you can record every session you've gotgoing; just make sure you record each session in a separatefile.) It's harder to decide what to record of the events that don'tjust get automatically captured. You certainly want to record at leastthis much:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Who you called, when, and why.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">A summary of what you told them.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">A summary of what they told you.
