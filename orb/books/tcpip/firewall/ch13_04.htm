You may personally be able to mount asensible response to an attack, but you aren't necessarily going to bethe person who discovers one. You may not even be available at thetime. How will your organization react if someone attacks your system?Unless you have an incident response plan in place, the peopleinvolved will waste valuable time trying to figure out what to dofirst.</P><PCLASS="para">If you already have a plan in place for disaster or emergency responseof any kind (e.g., fire, earthquake, electrical problems), you'reprobably not going to have to change it significantly to meet yoursecurity needs. If you don't have such a plan already, you can probablyuse your security incident response plan with only minor modificationsfor most emergencies.</P><PCLASS="para">Your incident response plan need not be an elaborate document, but youneed to have <EMCLASS="emphasis">something</EM>, even if it's only an emailmessage that records and confirms the details you've all worked out overlunch at the local sushi bar. You'll be better off than many sites evenif you do nothing more than think about the issues and discuss them withthe relevant people.</P><PCLASS="para">What's in your plan? </P><PCLASS="para">The response plan is primarily concerned with two issues: authorityand communication. For each part of the incident response, the planshould say who's in charge, and who they're supposed to talkto. Although you'll specify a few steps people will take, incidentsvary so much that the response plan mostly details who'sgoing to make decisions, and who they're going to contact afterthey've decided&nbsp;- not what they're going to decide. This sectionsummarizes the different parts of a response plan.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S2-8">13.4.1 Planning for Detection </A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21929"></A>An incident starts when somebody detects an intruder or attacker. Thatperson might be a system administrator, but more often it's someonewith no official responsibility. If you've properly educated thepeople who use your computers, they know they're supposed toreport weird events. Somebody then needs to sort run-of-the-millpeculiarities from a security incident in progress. Who are the usersgoing to report to? Who are those people going to report to if they'restill not sure? What are they authorized to do if they are sure?</P><PCLASS="para">The two cases you really want to plan for are these:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Somebody notices a real security incident in progress at 3<SPANCLASS="acronym">A.M.</SPAN></P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Somebody notices one of your perfectly legitimate users who happens tobe doing vital work from halfway across the globe at 3<SPANCLASS="acronym">A.M.</SPAN> local time. (In Australia, where he'sconsulting at the moment, it's a reasonable 5 <SPANCLASS="acronym">P.M.</SPAN>)</P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">In the first case, you need a procedure which is going to reliably startup a full incident response immediately. Don't waste any time. It'sgoing to be embarrassing and expensive if you don't actually get aroundto doing anything until your senior security person arrives in the nextmorning, takes in enough caffeine to become able to think, and getsaround to looking at some report. (And that's if there is a report inthe first place; without a response plan, it may be weeks beforeanyone actually tells someone who can begin to do something about thesituation.) </P><PCLASS="para">In the second case, it's going to be embarrassing and expensive if youdisconnect the network and get five people out of bed, all to preventsomebody from doing the work they're paid to do. </P><PCLASS="para">Either way, it's not a decision you probably want made by a nightoperator, or by a user acting alone because he can't figure out how tocall somebody who knows how to tell a real incident from a false alarm.</P><PCLASS="para">At a small site, you might want to simply post a number that users cancall to get help outside of office hours (for instance, a pager number).Users might be encouraged to shut down personal machines if they suspectan attack and know how to shut the machine down gracefully. You want tobe very cautious about this, however, because an ungraceful shutdown,particularly of a multiuser machine, may be more damaging than anintruder. </P><PCLASS="para">At a larger site, one that has on-site support after hours, you shouldinstruct the on-site support people to call a senior person if theysee a possible security incident. They should be toldexplicitly not to do anything more than that unless circumstances areextreme, but to keep trying to contact senior personnel until they getsomebody who can take a look at what's going on.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S2-9">13.4.2 Planning for Evaluation of the Incident</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21949"></A>Who's going to decide that you don't just have a suspicioussituation&nbsp;- you actually have a security problem? You need to designateone specific person who will have responsibility for making theimportant decisions.  It's tempting to pick one specific person inadvance and put his or her name in your plan. But, what if thatperson isn't available in the event of an actual incident? Who, then,will have the responsibility?</P><PCLASS="para">Teamwork is great, but emergencies call for leadership. You don't wantto have everybody doing their own thing and nobody in charge, and youcertainly can't afford to stand around arguing about it. If your seniortechnical person is absent, do you want someone less senior but moretechnical to do the evaluation, or do you want someone more senior butless technical? How much time are you going to spend searching for thesenior technical person when you have an emergency to deal with, beforeproceeding to your next candidate for the hot seat?</P><PCLASS="para">At a small site, you may not have a lot of options; if there's only oneperson who has the skills necessary to do something about an attack,your policy will simply list that person as the one in charge in case ofa security incident. If that person is unavailable, authority should goto somebody levelheaded and calm who can take stopgap actions andarrange for assistance (for example, from a relevant response team). Inthis situation, technical skills would be nice, but resourcefulness andcalm are more important.</P><PCLASS="para">At a larger site, there is probably more than one person who could be incharge. Your plan may want to say that the most senior of them will bein charge by default, or that whoever is specified as being on call willbe in charge. Either way, the plan should state that if the defaultperson in charge is unavailable, the first of the other possible peopleto respond is in charge. Specifying what order they're going to becontacted in is probably overkill; let whoever is trying to reachthese people use his or her knowledge of the situation. If none of thosepeople are available, you'll usually want to work up the organizationalhierarchy rather than down. (A manager, particularly a technical one, isprobably better equipped to cope than an operator.)</P><PCLASS="para">In a small organization, you will pick your fallback candidates byname. In a large one, you will usually specify fallbacks by jobtitle. If job title is your criterion, it's important to base yourdecision on the characteristics of the job, not of the personcurrently in it. Don't write into your plan that the janitor shoulddecide, on the theory that the current janitor also is the mostsensible and technical of those who aren't systemadministrators. The next janitor might be an airhead with a mop.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S2-10">13.4.3 Planning for Disconnecting orShutting Down Machines</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21959"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21961"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21963"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21966"></A>Your response plan needs to specify what kind of situation warrantsdisconnecting or shutting down, and who can make the decision to dothat. Most importantly, as we've discussed in &quot;Pursuing andCapturing the Intruder,&quot; are you ever willing to allow a knownintruder to remain connected to your systems? If you're not, are yougoing to take down the system, or are you going to disconnect from thenetwork altogether? </P><PCLASS="para">If you are at a site with multiple computer facilities, do you want totake the entire site off the Internet if one facility has been compromised,or is it better (or even possible) to take just that facility off theInternet?</P><PCLASS="para">At most sites, the reasonable plan is to disconnect the site as awhole from the network as soon as you know for sure that you have anintruder connected to your systems. You may have a myriad of internalconnections, with a triply redundant, diversely cabled,<SPANCLASS="acronym">UPS</SPAN>-protected routing mesh, which can make&quot;disconnecting&quot; a daunting prospect (the system keeps&quot;fixing&quot; itself). On the other hand, you probably onlyhave one (or a small handful) of connections to the outside world,which can be more easily severed.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21973"></A>Your plan needs to say how to disconnect the network, and how themachines should be shut down. Be very careful about this. You do notwant to tell people to respond to a mildly suspicious act by hittingthe circuit breakers and powering off every machine in the machineroom. On the other hand, if an intruder is currently removing all thefiles on the machine, you don't want them to give that intruder a15-minute warning for a graceful shutdown.</P><PCLASS="para">This is one case in which you need clear, security-specific instructionsin your plan. Here's what we recommend you do:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">In most security emergencies, the correct way to shut down themachine is to do an immediate but graceful shutdown, with noexplanations or warnings sent. Your plan should state that and specifythe appropriate commands to issue. </P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If the intruder is actively destroying things, you want people to shutthe machine down by the fastest method possible. If they are physicallynear the machine, cutting off the power to the machine or the disk driveis completely appropriate, despite the damage it may cause. This impliesthat the relevant power switches must be easy to locate; a master switchfor each machine is a good idea.</P></LI></UL></P><PCLASS="para">Whoever is going to disconnect the network needs to know how to do that.Often, the safest and easiest way is to unplug cables and clean up theside effects afterwards. With networks, this tends to result involuminous error messages but to cause no actual damage. You do have tounplug the <EMCLASS="emphasis">relevant </EM> cables, however, and thevoluminous error messages may make it difficult to determine whether ornot the cables that were unplugged were actually the correct ones. Yourplan needs to tell people what to unplug, and how to make thingsfunctional afterwards.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S2-11">13.4.4 Planning for Notification of PeopleWho Need to Know</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21987"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21990"></A>Your incident response plan needs to specify who you're going to notify,who's going to do the notification, when they're going to do it, andwhat method they're going to use. As we described earlier in thischapter, you may need to notify:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">People within your own organization</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN> or other incident response teams</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Vendors and service providers</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">People at other sites</P></LI></UL></P><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S4-1">13.4.4.1 Your own organization</A></H4><PCLASS="para">To start with, you need to notify the people who are going to beinvolved in the response. You'll have an urgent need to get hold ofthem, so you need telephone and pager numbers. Be sure youhave all the relevant phone numbers; in addition to home and worknumbers, check to see if people have car phones or portable phones atwhich they might be reached. This list includes anybody whomanages computers within your site and anybody who manages thosepeople, plus anybody else who might be needed to provide resources (tosign off on emergency purchases or to unlock doors, for example).Ideally, the list&nbsp;- or at least the key portions of it&nbsp;- should bereduced down so it's small enough to carry easily (for example, it mightbe laser-printed onto business card-sized stock). Obviously, the listisn't much use unless it's kept up to date.</P><PCLASS="para">If there are many people to be notified, you may wish to use a phonetree or an alert tree. In such a tree, shown in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch13_04.htm#FIRE-13-FIG-2"TITLE="An alert tree">Figure 13.2</A>, each person notifies two or three otherpeople; this is a geometric progression, so a large number of peoplecan be rapidly notified with relatively little work to any oneperson. Everybody should have a copy of the entire tree, so that ifpeople are unavailable their calls can be taken over by someone else(usually the person above them on the tree).  It's best to set it upso as many calls as possible are toll-free, and so that people arenotifying other people they know relatively well (which increasestheir chances of knowing how to get through). There's no need for analert tree to reflect an organizational chart or a chain of command.</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-FIG-2">Figure 13.2: An alert tree</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire1302.gif"ALT="Figure 13.2"><PCLASS="para">Next, you're going to notify other people within your organization whoneed to know, starting with the users of your computer facility. Forthat, you'll use whatever your organization normally uses for relativelyurgent notifications to everybody, whether that's memos or electronicmail. Your plan should specify how to do that (system administratorsrarely send memos to all personnel and may not know how). </P><PCLASS="para">Your plan should also show a sample notification message for the usersof your systems.

Writing an appropriate message (see <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch13_04.htm#FIRE-13-FIG-3"TITLE="A notification message">Figure 13.3</A>) is not easy, particularly if you're busy andtired.</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-FIG-3">Figure 13.3: A notification message</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/fire1303.gif"ALT="Figure 13.3"><PCLASS="para">For the remaining people within your organization&nbsp;- people fromother computer facilities, legal, audit, public relations, orsecurity&nbsp;- the plan needs to specify who gets notified. Do youneed to call the legal department? If so, who should you talk to? Whoare the administrators for other sites within your organization?During the Morris worm incident in 1988, at least one large governmentlab was reduced to having the guards hand out flyers at the gate toeveryone as they came to work, asking &quot;Are you a systemadministrator?&quot; because they had no idea who all the systemadministrators were, much less how to contact them.</P><PCLASS="para">Think about <EMCLASS="emphasis">how</EM> you are going to send yourmessage.  If you send it via electronic mail, remember that theintruder may see it. Even if you know that your own systems are clean,don't assume that other people's are. Don't say anything in yourmessage that you don't want the attacker to know. Better yet, use atelephone.</P><PCLASS="para">Some sites use a simple code phrase to announce a system attack thatthey can include in electronic mail. This can rapidly degenerate intobad spy fiction, but if you have an agreed-upon phrase that isn'tgoing to alert an intruder (and isn't going to cause people who don'tknow it or don't remember it to give the game away by asking what onearth you're talking about), it can be effective. Something like&quot;We're having a pizza party; call 3-4357 to<SPANCLASS="acronym">RSVP</SPAN>&quot; should serve the purpose.</P><PCLASS="para">Should you contact your organization's security department? At someorganizations, the security department is responsible only forphysical security. You'll want to have a contact number for them incase you need doors unlocked, for example, but they are unlikely to betrained in helping with an emergency of this kind, so you probablywon't need to notify them routinely of every computer securityincident. However, if there is a group responsible for computersecurity within your organization, you are probably required to notifythem. Find out ahead of time when they want to be notified and how,and put that information in the plan. Even if that group cannot helpyou respond to your particular type of incident (e.g., they may bepersonal-computer specialists, or government-security specialists),it's advisable to at least brief them on the incident after you havefinished responding to it.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S4-2">13.4.4.2 CERT-CC and other incident response teams</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-22043"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-22045"></A>Your plan should also specify what emergency response team, if any,you're served by and how to contact them. <SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN>and many teams in the <SPANCLASS="acronym">FIRST</SPAN> have 24-hour numbers,and they prefer to be called immediately if a security incidentoccurs.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-13-S4-3">13.4.4.3 Vendors and service providers</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-22052"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-22055"></A>Your plan should also contain the contact numbers for your vendors andInternet service providers.

(See thesection called &quot;Do Drills&quot; at the end of this chapter.) Forexample, a live drill may uncover any of the following:<ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">That you've changed all your storage since the plan was written.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">That you can't actually restore your operating system fromscratch.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">That your plan relies on the ability to use the network to reachexternal sites, but at the same time instructs you to disconnect thenetwork. </P></LI></UL></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch13_03.htm"TITLE="13.3 Pursuing and Capturing the Intruder"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 13.3 Pursuing and Capturing the Intruder"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch13_05.htm"TITLE="13.5 Being Prepared "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 13.5 Being Prepared "BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">13.3 Pursuing and Capturing the Intruder</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">13.5 Being Prepared </TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
