It isestimated that the Internet now has about 30 to 40 millionusers. Even if the percentage of malicious users is less than onepercent of the overall society, the potential number of malicioususers is large enough so that it should concern you.</P><PCLASS="para">The number of security incidents reported to the Computer EmergencyResponse Team Coordination Center (<SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN>)increases every year&nbsp;- less than 200 in 1989, about 400 in 1991, 1400in 1993, and 2,241 in 1994. Estimates are that we'll see more than3000 reported incidents in 1995.  Incidents occur at government andmilitary sites, among Fortune 500 companies, at universities, and atsmall startups. Some incidents involve a single account on a singlesystem. Some (for example, those involving packet sniffers) mightinvolve as many as 100,000 systems.  Of course, these numbers are onlythe tip of the iceberg. Many intrusions aren't reported to the<SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT</SPAN> Coordination Center or to other computersecurity incident response organizations.  In fact, many aren'treported at all&nbsp;- in some cases, because the victimized organizationwould rather avoid publicity or charges of carelessness, in othercases because the intrusions are not even detected.</P><PCLASS="para">Nobody knows the correct statistics on how many attacks areactually detected by the sites broken into, but most people in thesecurity community agree that only a few percent are. Here's one ofthe few statistics I can cite: one incident response team offers anetwork intrusion service to its customers. With the customer'spermission, they try to penetrate a system using the same tools thatintruders use in their own attacks. This team found that only 4% ofthe sites probed detected the penetration attempts. An even morefrightening estimate: Bill Cheswick of <SPANCLASS="acronym">AT&T</SPAN> BellLabs believes that of those attacks that do succeed, at least 40% ofthe attackers gain root access.[1] </P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] <EMCLASS="emphasis">Firewalls Digest</EM>, March 31, 1995.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">It isn't only the numbers of incidents that are growing; it's thesophistication of the methods of attack. When the<SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT</SPAN> Coordination Center was founded in the wake ofthe Internet worm in the fall of 1988, the attacks we faced fell intotwo major categories: password guessing and the exploiting of securityholes in operating systems and system programs. Although too manysites still fall victim to such attacks, we're now seeing increasingtechnical complexity in most of the newer incidents. To some extent,this is the result of increasing consciousness among system users andsystem administrators&nbsp;- users are choosing better passwords, andadministrators are applying system patches more quickly.Unfortunately, the result of this increased security consciousnessisn't to stamp out security attacks; it's simply to force theattackers to learn new tricks. Many of today's attacks are moresophisticated. They include the forging of Internet Protocol(<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN>) addresses (intruders are guessing the sequencenumbers associated with network connections and the acknowledgmentsbetween machines), the exploiting of the source routing option on<SPANCLASS="acronym">IP</SPAN> packets on certain types of<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> systems, and the hijacking of open terminal orlogin sessions.</P><PCLASS="para">This is not to say that all users and administrators have learnedtheir lessons about old-style attacks. There is still more educationthat needs to be done among users and administrators, as well as amongmanagers, who too often won't budget what's needed for securitytraining. It's a dangerous world in cyberspace, and too few peoplerealize it.  This is one way in which the growth of the Internet mayactually have hurt us.  In the early days of the Internet, sitesconnected to the net usually had a whole staff of hardware andsoftware gurus. Today, connecting to the Internet is so easy thatsites forget it takes technical sophistication to connect safely andto stay secure.</P><PCLASS="para">Several years ago, I worked with a site in Europe that apparently hadbeen broken into by someone who used a site in the United States tolaunch the attack. When I contacted the system administrator at the<SPANCLASS="acronym">U.S.</SPAN> site, she assured me that they didn't evenhave computers at their location that were connected to theInternet. I told her the full domain name of the suspect system, andshe replied, &quot;Oh, you mean the Sun.&quot; It turned out that the Sun hadbeen installed for use in a special application and had been runningfor years without anyone at the site realizing that it was connectedto the Internet. The administrator assured me that they woulddisconnect the machine. Well, next morning, the European manager sentme another flaming email message&nbsp;- another break-in from the same<SPANCLASS="acronym">U.S.</SPAN> system. I called the <SPANCLASS="acronym">U.S.</SPAN>system administrator. Yes, she'd disconnected the modems. Yes, she'ddisconnected the <SPANCLASS="acronym">CRT</SPAN>s. But through it all, she'dmanaged to leave the system connected to the Internet. She didn't knowit, but the attacker did, and he continued to take advantage of thefact.</P><PCLASS="para">I talk to system administrators all the time who are frustrated bybreak-ins, but who haven't done the basics that might prevent thesebreak-ins from succeeding. One system administrator complained that hehad reloaded his systems multiple times, and he was still beingattacked. It turned out that, although he knew about<SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT</SPAN> advisories and vendor security bulletins, he'dnever bothered installing them. For example, <SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT</SPAN>Advisory CA-93:16 was posted to the net in November of 1993; itadvised the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> community about a problem withmost versions of Sendmail. Vendors had cooperated by providingreplacement programs, and the advisory contained a replacement for the<EMCLASS="emphasis">/bin/sh</EM> program used in the MProg line of the<EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail.cf</EM> file. A year and a half later,<SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT</SPAN> still gets calls from sites that are brokeninto using this old Sendmail vulnerability.</P><PCLASS="para">Although the number of security incidents continues to increase andthe types of attacks become ever more sophisticated, still there isgood news for those who care about security. Overall, we've seen ahuge growth in awareness of the dangers of connecting to the Internet,and there's a lot of activity in the security community. Onemanifestation of that is the growth of the Forum of Incident Responseand Security Teams (<SPANCLASS="acronym">FIRST</SPAN>), which brings together avariety of computer security incident response teams (more than 40 atthe time I'm writing this) from government, commercial, and academicorganizations. Also heartening is the existence of ever-bettersecurity tools that our community makes freely available. The ComputerOperations, Audit, and Security Technology (<SPANCLASS="acronym">COAST</SPAN>)archive at Purdue is a central point for the collection and testing ofmany of these tools.  (<ACLASS="xref"HREF="appa_01.htm"TITLE="Resources">Appendix A, <CITECLASS="appendix">Resources</CITE></A> of this book tellsyou how to contact both organizations.) Finally, the publication ofsome excellent books and papers on Internet security makes thehard-won wisdom of those at the front available to others.</P><PCLASS="para">In these dangerous times, firewalls are the best way to keep your sitesecure. Although you've got to include other types of security in themix, if you're serious about connecting to the Internet, firewallsshould be at the very center of your security plans. Brent Chapman hasbeen known as the firewalls guru since the early days of firewalls onthe Internet; his Firewalls mailing list and his tutorials arewitness to that. Elizabeth Zwicky, especially through her work at theSystem Administrators Guild (<SPANCLASS="acronym">SAGE</SPAN>) is the voice ofsafe and rational system administration. Together, they have written abook that will raise consciousness of, and competence in, Internetsecurity to a new level.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="literallayout"><PCLASS="literallayout">Ed DeHart<BR><SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT</SPAN> Technical Advisor at the<BR><SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT</SPAN> Coordination Center (<SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT-CC</SPAN>)<BR>Software Engineering Institute<BR>Carnegie Mellon University<BR>Pittsburgh, PA<BR>June 1995</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">&nbsp;</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="PREFACE"HREF="prf2_01.htm"TITLE="Preface"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: Preface"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">&nbsp;</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_a.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">Preface</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
