Itprovides step-by-step explanations of how to design and install afirewall at your site, and how to configure Internet services such aselectronic mail, <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN>, the World Wide Web, andothers to work with a firewall. Firewalls are complex, though, and wecan't boil everything down to simple rules. Too much depends onexactly what hardware, operating system, and networking you are usingat your site, and what you want your users to be able to do, and notdo. We've tried to give you enough rules, examples, and resources hereso you'll be able to do the rest on your own.</P><PCLASS="para">What is a firewall, and what does it do for you? A firewall is a way torestrict access between the Internet and your internal network. Youtypically install a firewall at the point of maximum leverage, the pointwhere your network connects to the Internet. The existence of afirewall at your site can greatly reduce the odds that outside attackerswill penetrate your internal systems and networks. The firewall canalso keep your own users from compromising your systems by sendingdangerous information&nbsp;- unencrypted passwords and sensitive data&nbsp;- tothe outside world.</P><PCLASS="para">The attacks on Internet-connected systems we are seeing today aremore serious and more technically complex than those in the past. To keep these attacks from compromising our systems,we need all the help we can get. Firewalls are a highly effective wayof protecting your site from these attacks. For that reason, westrongly recommend you include a firewall in your site's overallInternet security plan. However, a firewall should be only onecomponent in that plan. It's also vital that you establish a securitypolicy, that you implement strong host security, and that you considerthe use of authentication and encryption devices that work with thefirewalls you install. This book will touch on each of these topicswhile maintaining its focus on firewalls.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="FIRE-PRE-S1-1">Scope of This Book</A></H2><PCLASS="para">This book is divided into four parts:</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="part01.htm"TITLE="Network Security">Part I, <CITECLASS="part">Network Security</CITE></A>, explores the problem ofInternet security and focuses on firewalls as part of an effective strategy to solve that problem.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch01_01.htm"TITLE="Why Internet Firewalls?">Chapter 1, <CITECLASS="chapter">Why Internet Firewalls?</CITE></A>, introduces the major risks associated withusing the Internet today; discusses what to protect, and what toprotect it against; discusses various security models; and introducesfirewalls in the context of what they can and can't do for your site'ssecurity.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch02_01.htm"TITLE="Internet Services">Chapter 2, <CITECLASS="chapter">Internet Services</CITE></A>, outlines the services users want and need fromthe Internet, and summarizes the security problems posed by thoseservices.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch03_01.htm"TITLE="Security Strategies">Chapter 3, <CITECLASS="chapter">Security Strategies</CITE></A>, outlines the basic security principles anorganization needs to understand before it adopts a security policyand invests in specific security mechanisms.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="part02.htm"TITLE="Building Firewalls">Part II, <CITECLASS="part">Building Firewalls</CITE></A>, describes how to build firewalls and configureservices to run with them.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch04_01.htm"TITLE="Firewall Design">Chapter 4, <CITECLASS="chapter">Firewall Design</CITE></A>,outlines the basic components and major architectures used inconstructing firewalls: dual-homed hosts, screened hosts, screenedsubnets, and variations on these basic architectures.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch05_01.htm"TITLE="Bastion Hosts">Chapter 5, <CITECLASS="chapter">Bastion Hosts</CITE></A>,presents step-by-step instructions on designing and building the bastionhosts used in many firewall configurations.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch06_01.htm"TITLE="Packet Filtering">Chapter 6, <CITECLASS="chapter">Packet Filtering</CITE></A>,describes how packet filtering systems work, and discusses what you canand can't accomplish with them in building a firewall.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch07_01.htm"TITLE="Proxy Systems">Chapter 7, <CITECLASS="chapter">Proxy Systems</CITE></A>,describes how proxy clients and servers work, and how to use thesesystems in building a firewall.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring Internet Services">Chapter 8, <CITECLASS="chapter">Configuring Internet Services</CITE></A>, describes how to configure each major Internetservice to run with a firewall.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch09_01.htm"TITLE="Two Sample Firewalls">Chapter 9, <CITECLASS="chapter">Two Sample Firewalls</CITE></A>, presents two sample configurations for basicfirewalls.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch10_01.htm"TITLE="Authentication and Inbound Services">Chapter 10, <CITECLASS="chapter">Authentication and InboundServices</CITE></A>, discusses the problem of allowing users toaccess your systems from the Internet, and describes a variety ofauthentication strategies and products.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="part03.htm"TITLE="Keeping Your Site Secure">Part III, <CITECLASS="part">Keeping Your Site Secure</CITE></A>, describes howto establish a security policy for your site, maintain your firewall,and handle the security problems that may occur with even the mosteffective firewalls.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch11_01.htm"TITLE="Security Policies">Chapter 11, <CITECLASS="chapter">Security Policies</CITE></A>, discusses the importance of having a clear andwell-understood security policy for your site, and what that policyshould and should not contain.
