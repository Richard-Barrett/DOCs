We would never have succeeded withoutthe help of many people.</P><PCLASS="para">Special thanks to Ed DeHart and Craig Hunt. Ed worked with Brent inthe early stages of this book and wrote the foreword to it; weappreciate all that he has done to help. <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> isessential for understanding the basics of firewall construction, andCraig Hunt, author of <EMCLASS="emphasis"><SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> NetworkAdministration</EM> has kindly let us excerpt much of thatbook's Chapters 1 and 2 in this book's <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appc_01.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Fundamentals">Appendix C</A> soreaders who do not already have a <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN> backgroundcan get a jump start.</P><PCLASS="para">Thanks to all those who reviewed drafts of the book before publicationand made helpful suggestions: Fred Avolio, Steve Bellovin, NielsBjergstrom, Rik Farrow, Simson Garfinkel, Eliot Lear, Evi Nemeth,Steve Simmons, Steve Romig, Gene Spafford, Phil Trubey, and MarkVerber. Thanks as well to Eric Allman for answering many Sendmailquestions and Paul Traina for answering many Cisco questions.</P><PCLASS="para">Thanks to all the people at O'Reilly &amp; Associates who turned thismanuscript into a finished book: to Mary Anne Weeks Mayo, thewonderful and patient project manager/copyeditor for the book;Len Muellner, Ellen Siever, and Norm Walsh who converted the book fromWord to <SPANCLASS="acronym">SGML</SPAN> and contributed their tool-tweakingprowess; Chris Reilley who created the many excellent diagrams; EdieFreedman who designed the cover and Nancy Priest who designed theinterior layout; John Files and Juliette Muellner who assisted withproduction; Seth Maislin who prepared the index; and Sheryl Avruch andKismet McDonough-Chan who did the final quality control on the book.</P><PCLASS="para">Brent says: I would like to extend personal thanks to my friends andfamily, for keeping me going for a year and a half while I worked onthe book; to my staff at Great Circle Associates, for keeping mybusiness going; to the many hundreds of folks who've attended myInternet Security Firewalls Tutorial, for providing the impetus forthis whole endeavor (and for keeping my bills paid!); and to the manythousands of subscribers to the Firewalls mailing list on theInternet, for providing a stimulating environment to develop many ofthe ideas found in this book. I also owe a lot of thanks to DebbyRussell, our editor at O'Reilly &amp; Associates, for all her help andguidance, and to our technical reviewers, for all their wonderfulcomments and suggestions.  Most of all, though, I'd like to thank myvery good friend and coauthor, Elizabeth Zwicky, without whosecollaboration and encouragement this book probably never would havebeen finished, and certainly wouldn't have been as good.</P><PCLASS="para">Elizabeth says: My thanks go to my friends, my family, and my colleaguesat Silicon Graphics, for an almost infinite patience with my tendency toalternate between obsessing about the book and refusing to discussanything even tangentially related to it. I'd like to particularly thankArnold Zwicky, Diana Smetters, Greg Rose, Eliot Lear, and JeanneDusseault for their expert moral support (often during similar crises oftheir own). But the most thanks for this effort have to go to Debby andBrent, for giving me a chance to be part of an unexpected but extremelyrewarding project. </P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf2_05.htm"TITLE="Online Information"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: Online Information"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Building Internet Firewalls"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="PART"HREF="part01.htm"TITLE="I.
