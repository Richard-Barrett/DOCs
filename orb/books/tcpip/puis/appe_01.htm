The firstedition of <EMCLASS="emphasis">Practical UNIX Security</EM>, for instance, was written between1989 and 1990, and published in 1991. This revised edition was startedin 1995 and not published until 1996. Interim reprintings incorporatedcorrections, but did not include new material.</P><PCLASS="para">Some of the programs listed in this appendix appear to be&quot;dead,&quot; or, in the vernacular jargon of academia,&quot;completed.&quot; For instance, consider the case of<SPANCLASS="acronym">COPS</SPAN>, developed as a student project by Dan Farmerat Purdue University under the direction of Gene Spafford. The <SPANCLASS="acronym">COPS</SPAN>program is still referenced by many first-rate texts on computersecurity. But as of early 1996, <SPANCLASS="acronym">COPS</SPAN> hasn'tbeen updated in more than four years and fails to install cleanlyon many major versions of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX;</SPAN> Dan Farmer haslong since left Gene's tutelage and gone on to fame, fortune,and other projects (such as the <SPANCLASS="acronym">SATAN</SPAN> tool).<SPANCLASS="acronym">COPS</SPAN> rests moribund on the <SPANCLASS="acronym">COAST</SPAN><SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN> server, apparently a dead project. Nevertheless,before this book is revised for a third time, there exists the chancethat someone else will take up <SPANCLASS="acronym">COPS</SPAN> and put anew face on it. And, we note that there is still some value in applying<SPANCLASS="acronym">COPS</SPAN>&nbsp;- some of the flaws that it findsare <EMCLASS="emphasis">still</EM> present in systems shipped by somevendors (assuming that you can get the program to compile).</P><PCLASS="para">We thus present the following electronic resources with theunderstanding that this list necessarily cannot be complete norcompletely up to date. What we hope, instead, is that it is expansive.By reading it, we hope that you will gain insight into places tolook for future developments in computer security. Along the way,you may find some information you can put to immediate use.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-APP-E-SECT-1">E.1 Mailing Lists</A></H2><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-40602"></A>There aremany mailing lists that cover security-related material. We describea few of the major ones here. However, this is not to imply thatonly these lists are worthy of mention! There may well be otherlists of which we are unaware, and many of the lesser-known listsoften have a higher volume of good information.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="note"><PCLASS="para"><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> <EMCLASS="emphasis">Never </EM>place blind faith in anythingyou read in a mailing list, especially if the list is unmoderated.There are a number of self-styled experts on the net who will nothesitate to volunteer their views, whether knowledgeable or not.Usually their advice is benign, but sometimes it is quite dangerous.There may also be people who are providing bad advice on purpose,as a form of vandalism. And certainly there are times where thereal experts make a mistake or two in what they recommend in anoffhand note posted to the net.</P><PCLASS="para">There are some real experts on these lists who are (happily)willing to share their knowledge with the community, and their contributionsmake the Internet a better place. However, keep in mind that simplybecause you read it on the network does not mean that the informationis correct for your system or environment, does not mean that ithas been carefully thought out, does not mean that it matches yoursite policy, and most certainly does not mean that it will helpyour security. <EMCLASS="emphasis">Always</EM> evaluate carefully theinformation you receive before acting on it.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-APP-E-SECT-1.1">E.1.1 Response Teams and Vendors</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-40612"></A>Manyof the incident response teams (listed in Appendix F) have mailinglists for their advisories and alerts. If you can be classifiedas one of their constituents, you should contact the appropriateteam(s) to be placed on their mailing lists.</P><PCLASS="para">Many vendors also have mailing lists for updates and advisoriesconcerning their products. These include computer vendors, firewallvendors, and vendors of security software (including some freewareand shareware products). You may wish to contact your vendors tosee if they have such lists, and if so, join.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-APP-E-SECT-1.2">E.1.2 A Big Problem With Mailing Lists</A></H3><PCLASS="para">The problem with all these lists is that you can easily overwhelmyourself. If you are on lists from two response teams, four vendors,and another half-dozen general-purpose lists, you may find yourselffiltering several hundred messages a day whenever a new generalvulnerability is discovered. At the same time, you don'twant to unsubscribe from these lists, because you might then missthe timely announcement of a special-case fix for your own systems.</P><PCLASS="para">One method that we have seen others use with some successis to split the mailing lists up among a group of administrators.Each person gets one or two lists to monitor, with particularlyuseful messages then redistributed to the entire group. Be certainto arrange coverage of these lists if someone leaves or goes onvacation, however!</P><PCLASS="para">Another approach is to feed these messages into Usenet newsgroupsyou create locally especially for this purpose. This strategy allowsyou to read the messages using an advanced newsreader that willallow you to kill message chains or trigger on keywords. It mayalso help provide an archiving mechanism to allow you to keep severaldays or weeks (or more) of the messages.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-APP-E-SECT-1.3">E.1.3 Major Mailing Lists</A></H3><PCLASS="para">These are some of the major mailing lists.</P><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-APP-E-SECT-1.3.1">E.1.3.1 Academic-Firewalls</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-40627"></A>The Academic-Firewallsmailing list is for people interested in discussing firewalls inthe academic environment.
