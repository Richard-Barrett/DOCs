Rarely doesa month go by without news of some major network or organizationhaving its computers penetrated by unknown computer criminals. Althoughsome computer &quot;hackers&quot; (see the sidebar below)have said that such intrusions are merely teenage pranks or funand games, these intrusions have become more sinister in recentyears: computers have been rendered inoperable; records have beensurreptitiously altered; software has been replaced with secret&quot;back doors&quot; in place; proprietary informationhas been copied without authorization; and millions of passwordshave been captured from unsuspecting users.</P><PCLASS="para">Even if nothing is removed or altered, system administratorsmust often spend hours or days reloading and reconfiguring a compromisedsystem to regain some level of confidence in the system'sintegrity. There is no way to know the motives of an intruder andthe worst must be assumed. <EMCLASS="emphasis">People</EM> <EMCLASS="emphasis">whobreak into systems simply to &quot;look around&quot; do real damage, evenif they do not read confidential mail and do not delete any files.</EM> If computer security was once the subject of fun andgames, those days have long since passed.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-528"></A>Many differentkinds of people break into computer systems. Some people&nbsp;- perhapsthe most widely publicized&nbsp;- are the equivalent of recklessteenagers out on electronic joy rides. Like youths who &quot;borrow&quot;fast cars, their main goal isn't necessarily to do damage,but to have what they consider to be a good time. Others are farmore dangerous: some people who compromise system security are sociopaths,joyriding around the networks bent on inflicting damage on unsuspectingcomputer systems. Others see themselves at &quot;war&quot;with rival hackers; woe to innocent users and systems who happento get in the way of cyberspace &quot;drive-by shootings!&quot;Still others are out for valuable corporate information, which theyhope to resell for profit. There are also elements of organizedcrime, spies and saboteurs motivated by both greed and politics,terrorists, and single-minded anarchists using computers and networks.</P><DIVCLASS="sidebar"><H4CLASS="sidebar"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-530">Who Is a Computer Hacker?</A></H4><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="blockquote"><PCLASS="para">HACKER noun 1. A person who enjoys learning the details ofcomputer systems and how to stretch their capabilities&nbsp;- asopposed to most users of computers, who prefer to learn only theminimum amount necessary. 2. One who programs enthusiastically orwho enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Guy L. Steele, et al.,  The Hacker's Dictionary </P><PCLASS="para">There was a time when computersecurity professionals argued over the term &quot;hacker.&quot;<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-536"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-538"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-540"></A> Some thought that hackers wereexcellent and somewhat compulsive computer programmers, like RichardStallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation. Others thoughtthat hackers were computer criminals, more like convicted felonMark Abene, a.k.a &quot;Phiber Optik.&quot; Complicatingthis discussion was the fact that many computer security professionalshad formerly been hackers themselves&nbsp;- of both persuasions.Some were anxious to get rid of the word, while others wished topreserve it.</P><PCLASS="para">Today the confusion over the term hacker has largely beenresolved. While some computer professionals continue to call themselves&quot;hackers,&quot; most don't. In the mind ofthe public, the word &quot;hacker&quot; has been firmlydefined as a person exceptionally talented with computers who oftenmisuses that skill. Use of the term by members of the news media,law enforcement, and the entertainment industry has only servedto reinforce this definition.</P><PCLASS="para">In some cases, we'll refer to people who break intocomputers, and present a challenge for computer security, by a varietyof names: &quot;crackers,&quot; &quot;bad guys,&quot;and occasionally &quot;hackers.&quot; However, in general,we will try to avoid these labels and use more descriptive terms:&quot;intruders,&quot; &quot;vandals,&quot; or simply,&quot;criminals.&quot;</P></DIV><PCLASS="para">The most dangerous computer criminals are usually insiders(or former insiders), because they know many of the codes and securitymeasures that are already in place. Consider the case of a formeremployee who is out for revenge. The employee probably knows whichcomputers to attack, which files will cripple the company the mostif deleted, what the defenses are, and where the backup tapes arestored.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-545"></A></P><PCLASS="para">Despite the risks, interest in computer networking and theInternet has never been greater. The number of computers attachedto the Internet has approximately doubled every year for nearlya decade. By all indications, this growth is likely to continuefor several years to come. With this increased interest in the Internet,there has been growing interest in <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> as theoperating system of choice for Internet gateways, high-end researchmachines, and advanced instructional platforms.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-550"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-552"></A>Years ago, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>was generally regarded as an operating system that was difficultto secure. This reputation was partially unfounded. Although partof <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>'s poor reputation came fromdesign flaws and bugs, a bigger cause for blame rested with thetraditional use of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> and with the poor securityconsciousness of its users. For its first 15 years, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>was used primarily in academia, the computing research community,the telephone company, and the computer industry itself. In mostof these environments, computer security was not a priority (untilperhaps recently). Users in these environments often configuredtheir systems with lax controls, and even developed philosophiesthat viewed strong security as something to avoid. Because theycater to this community (and hire from it), many <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>vendors have developed a culture that has been slow to incorporatemore practical security mechanisms into their products.[1]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] JamesEllis at <SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT</SPAN> suggests that another reason for<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>'s poor security record has to dowith the wide-spread availability of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> sourcecode, which allows for detailed inspection by potential attackersfor weaknesses. Buffer overflows or coding errors that would bereported on other systems as merely causing crashes are reportedfrequently on <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> with detailed programs thatbreak system security.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-567"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-569"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-572"></A>Perhapsthe best known demonstration of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> vulnerabilityto date occurred in November 1988. That was when Robert T. Morrisreleased his infamous &quot;Internet worm&quot; program,which spread to thousands of computers in a matter of hours. Thatevent served as a major wake-up call for many <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>users and vendors. Since then, users, academics, and computer manufacturershave usually worked together to try to improve the security of the<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> operating system. Many of the results ofthose efforts are described in this book.</P><PCLASS="para">But despite the increasing awareness and the improvementsin defenses, the typical <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> system is stillexposed to many dangers. The purpose of this book is to give readersa fundamental understanding of the principles of computer securityand to show how they apply to the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> operatingsystem. We hope to show you practical techniques and tools for makingyour system as secure as possible, especially if it is running someversion of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>. Whether you are a user or administrator,we hope that you will find value in these pages.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-1-SECT-1">1.1 What Is Computer Security?</A></H2><PCLASS="para">Terms like <ICLASS="firstterm">security</I>, <ICLASS="firstterm">protection</I>,and <ICLASS="firstterm">privacy</I> often have more than one meaning.Even professionals who work in information security do not agreeon exactly what these terms mean. The focus of this book is notformal definitions and theoretical models so much as practical,useful information. Therefore, we'll use an operationaldefinition of security and go from there.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-588"></A>Computer Security:&quot;A computer is secure if you can depend on it and its softwareto behave as you expect.&quot;</P><PCLASS="para">If you expect the data entered into your machine today tobe there in a few weeks, and to remain unread by anyone who is notsupposed to read it, then the machine is secure. This concept isoften called <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-592"></A>trust: you trust the systemto preserve and protect your data.</P><PCLASS="para">By this definition, <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-595"></A>naturaldisasters and <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-597"></A>buggy software are as muchthreats to security as unauthorized users. This belief is obviouslytrue from a practical standpoint. Whether your data is erased bya vengeful employee, a random virus, an unexpected bug, or a lightningstrike&nbsp;- the data is still gone.</P><PCLASS="para">Our practical definition might also imply to some that securityis concerned with issues of testing your software and hardware,and with preventing user mistakes. However, we don't intendour definition to be that inclusive. That's why the word&quot;practical&quot; is in the title of this book&nbsp;- andwhy we won't try to be more specific about defining what&quot;security&quot; is, exactly. A formal definition wouldn'tnecessarily help you any more than our working definition, and wouldrequire detailed explanations of risk assessment, asset valuation,policy formation, and a number of other topics beyond what we areable to present here.</P><PCLASS="para">On the other hand, knowing something about these conceptsis important in the long run. If you don't know what you'reprotecting, why you're protecting it, and what you areprotecting it from, your task will be rather difficult! Furthermore,you need to understand how to establish and apply uniform securitypolicies. Much of that is beyond the scope of what we hope to presenthere; thus, we'll discuss a few of these topics in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch02_01.htm"TITLE="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2, <CITECLASS="chapter">Policies and Guidelines</CITE></A>, Policies and Guidelines. We'll also recommend that you examine someof the references available. Several good introductory texts inthis area, including Computer Security Basics (Russell and Gangemi),Computer Crime: A Crimefighter's Handbook (Seger, VonStorch,and Icove), and Control and Security of Computer Information Systems(Fites, Kratz, and Brebner) are listed in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appd_01.htm"TITLE="Paper Sources">Appendix D, <CITECLASS="appendix">Paper Sources</CITE></A>.Other texts, university courses, and professional organizationscan provide you with more background. Security isn't aset of tricks, but an ongoing area of specialization.</P><PCLASS="para">This book emphasizes techniques to help keep your system safefrom other people&nbsp;- including both insiders and outsiders,those bent on destruction, and those who are simply ignorant oruntrained. The text does not detail every specific security-relatedfeature that is available only on certain versions of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>from specific manufacturers: companies that take the time to developsuch software usually deliver it with sufficient documentation.</P><PCLASS="para">Throughout this book, we will be presenting mechanisms andmethods of using them. To decide which mechanisms are right foryou, take a look at <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch02_01.htm"TITLE="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2</A>. Remember, each site must developits own overall security policies, and those policies will determinewhich mechanisms are appropriate to use. End users should also read<ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch02_01.htm"TITLE="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2</A>&nbsp;- users should be aware of policyconsiderations, too.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-609"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-611"></A>Forexample, if your local policy is that all users can build and installprograms that can be accessed by other users, then you may wishto set the file permissions on <ICLASS="filename">/usr/local/bin</I>to be mode 1777, which allows users to add their own files but doesnot generally allow them to delete files placed there by other users.If you don't wish to take the risk of allowing users toinstall publicly accessible programs that might contain Trojan horsesor trap doors,[2]a more appropriate file permissions setting for /usr/local/binmight be 755.[3]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[2] For an example of such a program, consider arogue user who installs a program called <ICLASS="filename">ls </I>thatoccasionally deletes files instead of listing them.</P><PCLASS="para">[3] See <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch05_01.htm"TITLE="The UNIX Filesystem">Chapter 5, <CITECLASS="chapter">The UNIX Filesystem</CITE></A>, for a discussion of these protection modes.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="PART"HREF="part01.htm"TITLE="I.
