When running a word processor,a computer becomes a machine for arranging words and ideas. Witha spreadsheet, the computer is a financial planning machine, onethat is vastly more powerful than a pocket calculator. Connectedto an electronic network, a computer becomes part of a powerfulcommunications system.</P><PCLASS="para">At the heart of every computer is a master set of programscalled the operating system. This is the software that controlsthe computer's input/output systems such as keyboardsand disk drives, and that loads and runs other programs. The operatingsystem is also a set of mechanisms and policies that help definecontrolled sharing of system resources.</P><PCLASS="para">Along with the operating system is a large set of standardutility programs for performing common functions such as copyingfiles and listing the contents of directories. Although these programsare not technically part of the operating system, they can havea dramatic impact on a computer system's security.</P><PCLASS="para">All of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> can be divided into three parts:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">The <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-633"></A>kernel,or the heart of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> system, is the operatingsystem. The kernel is a special program that is loaded into thecomputer when it is first turned on. The kernel controls all ofthe computer's input and output systems; it allows multipleprograms to run at the same time, and it allocates the system'stime and memory among them. The kernel includes the filesystem,which controls how files and directories are stored on the computer'shard disk. The filesystem is the main mechanism by which computersecurity is enforced. Some modern versions of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>allow user programs to load additional modules, such as device drivers,into the kernel after the system starts running.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Standard <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-639"></A>utilityprograms are run by users and by the system. Some programs are smalland serve a single function&nbsp;- for example, <KBDCLASS="command">/bin/ls</KBD>lists files and <KBDCLASS="command">/bin/cp </KBD>copies them.Other programs are large and perform many functions&nbsp;- forexample, <KBDCLASS="command">/bin/sh</KBD> and <KBDCLASS="command">/bin/csh</KBD>,<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-646"></A>shells thatprocess user commands, are themselves programming languages.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-650"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-653"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-656"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-658"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-660"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-662"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-665"></A>Systemdatabase files, most of which are relatively small, are used bya variety of programs on the system. One file, <ICLASS="filename">/etc/passwd</I>,contains the master list of every user on the system. Another file,<ICLASS="filename">/etc/group</I>, describes groups of users withsimilar access rights.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">From the point of view of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> security,these three parts interact with a fourth entity:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-675"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-677"></A>Security policy, which determines how the computeris run with respect to the users and system administration. Policyplays as important a role in determining your computer'ssecurity as the operating system software. A computer that is operatedwithout regard to security cannot be trusted, even if it is equippedwith the most sophisticated and security-conscious software. Forthis reason, establishing and codifying policy plays a very importantrole in the overall process of operating a secure system. This isdiscussed further in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch02_01.htm"TITLE="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2</A>.</P></LI></UL></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_01.htm"TITLE="1.1 What Is Computer Security?"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 1.1 What Is Computer Security?"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_03.htm"TITLE="1.3 History of UNIX"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 1.3 History of UNIX"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">1.1 What Is Computer Security?</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">1.3 History of UNIX</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
