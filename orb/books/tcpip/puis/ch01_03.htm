Most ofthe research took place in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at <SPANCLASS="acronym">MIT</SPAN>.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[4] A more comprehensive historyof <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>, from which some of the following isderived, is Peter Salus's book, A Quarter Century of UNIX,mentioned in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appd_01.htm"TITLE="Paper Sources">Appendix D</A>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para"><SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN> was a modular system built frombanks of high-speed processors, memory, and communications equipment.By design, parts of the computer could be shut down for servicewithout affecting other parts or the users. The goal was to providecomputer service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year&nbsp;- a computerthat could be made faster by adding more parts, much in the sameway that a power plant can be made bigger by adding more furnaces,boilers, and turbines. Although this level of processing is simplyassumed today, such a capability was not available when <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN>was begun.</P><PCLASS="para"><SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-708"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-710"></A>was also designedwith military security in mind. <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN> was designedboth to be resistant to external attacks and to protect the userson the system from each other. <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN> was tosupport the concept of <ICLASS="firstterm">multilevel security. </I>TopSecret, Secret, Confidential, and Unclassified information couldall coexist on the same computer. The <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN>operating system was designed to prevent information that had beenclassified at one level from finding its way into the hands of someonewho had not been cleared to see that information. <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN>eventually provided a level of security and service that is stillunequaled by many of today's computer systems&nbsp;- including,perhaps, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>.</P><PCLASS="para">In 1969, <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN> was far behind schedule.Its creators had promised far more than they could deliver withinthe projected time frame. Already at a disadvantage because of thedistance between its New Jersey laboratories and <SPANCLASS="acronym">MIT</SPAN>,AT&amp;T decided to pull out of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN>Project.</P><PCLASS="para">That year Ken <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-724"></A>Thompson,an AT&amp;T researcher who had worked on the <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN>Project, took over an unused <SPANCLASS="acronym">PDP</SPAN>-7 computer topursue some of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN> ideas on his own.Thompson was soon joined by <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-729"></A>DennisRitchie, who had also worked on <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN>. <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-732"></A>Peter Neumann suggested the name <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>for the new system. The name was a pun on the name <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN>and a backhanded slap at the project that was continuing in Cambridge(and indeed continued for another decade and a half). Whereas <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN>tried to do many things, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> tried to do onething well: run programs. The concept of strong security was notpart of this goal.</P><PCLASS="para">The smaller scope was all the impetus that the researchersneeded; an early version of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> was operationalseveral months before <SPANCLASS="acronym">MULTICS</SPAN>. Within a year,Thompson, Ritchie, and others rewrote <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> forDigital's new <SPANCLASS="acronym">PDP</SPAN>-11 <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-743"></A>computer.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-746"></A>As AT&amp;T's scientistsadded features to their system throughout the 1970s, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>evolved into a programmer's dream. The system was basedon compact programs, called tools, each of which performed a singlefunction. By putting tools together, programmers could do complicatedthings. <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX </SPAN>mimicked the way programmers thought.To get the full functionality of the system, users needed accessto all of these tools&nbsp;- and in many cases, to the sourcecode for the tools as well. Thus, as the system evolved, nearlyeveryone with access to the machines aided in the creation of newtools and in the debugging of existing ones.</P><PCLASS="para">In 1973, Thompson rewrote most of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>in Ritchie's newly invented C programming language. <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-752"></A>C was designed to be a simple, portablelanguage. Programs written in C could be moved easily from one kindof computer to another&nbsp;- as was the case with programs writtenin other high-level languages like <SPANCLASS="acronym">FORTRAN</SPAN>&nbsp;- yetthey ran nearly as fast as programs coded directly in a computer'snative machine language.</P><PCLASS="para">At least, that was the theory. In practice, every differentkind of computer at Bell Labs had its own operating system. C programswritten on the <SPANCLASS="acronym">PDP</SPAN>-11 could be recompiled onthe lab's other machines, but they didn't alwaysrun properly, because every operating system performed input andoutput in slightly different ways. Mike <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-757"></A>Leskdeveloped a &quot;<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-759"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-761"></A>portable <SPANCLASS="acronym">I/O</SPAN>library&quot; to overcome some of the incompatibilities, butmany remained. Then, in 1977, the group realized that it might beeasier to port the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> operating system itselfrather than trying to port all of the libraries. <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>was first ported to the lab's Interdata 8/32,a microcomputer similar to the <SPANCLASS="acronym">PDP</SPAN>-11. In 1978,the operating system was ported to Digital's new <SPANCLASS="acronym">VAX</SPAN>minicomputer. <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> still remained very much anexperimental operating system. Nevertheless, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>had become a popular operating system in many universities and wasalready being marketed by several companies. <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>was suddenly more than just a research curiosity.</P><PCLASS="para">Indeed, as early as 1973, there were more than 16 differentAT&amp;T or Western Electric sites outside Bell Labs runningthe operating system. <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> soon spread even further.Thompson and Ritchie presented a paper on the operating system atthe <SPANCLASS="acronym">ACM</SPAN> Symposium on Operating System Principles(<SPANCLASS="acronym">SOSP</SPAN>) in October 1973. Within a matter of months,sites around the world had obtained and installed copies of thesystem. Even though AT&amp;T was forbidden under the termsof its 1956 Consent Decree with the U.S. Federal government fromadvertising, marketing, or supporting computer software, demandfor <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> steadily rose. By 1977, more than 500sites were running the operating system; 125 of them were at universities,in the U.S. and more than 10 foreign countries. 1977 also saw thefirst commercial support for <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>, then at <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-778"></A>Version 6.</P><PCLASS="para">At most sites, and especially at universities, the typical<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> environment was like that inside Bell Labs:the machines were in well-equipped labs with restricted physicalaccess. The users who made extensive use of the machines were peoplewho had long-term access and who usually made significant modificationsto the operating system and its utilities to provide additionalfunctionality. They did not need to worry about security on thesystem because only authorized individuals had access to the machines.In fact, implementing security mechanisms often hindered the developmentof utilities and customization of the software. One of the authorsworked in two such labs in the early 1980s, and one location viewedhaving a password on the <ICLASS="filename">root</I> account as anannoyance because everyone who could get to the machine was authorizedto use it as the superuser!</P><PCLASS="para">This environment was perhaps best typified by the developmentat the University of California at Berkeley. Like other schools,Berkeley had paid $400 for a tape that included the completesource code to the operating system. Instead of merely running <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>,two of Berkeley's bright graduate students, Bill <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-786"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-788"></A>Joy and Chuck Haley, started makingsignificant modifications. In 1978, Joy sent out 30 copies of the&quot;<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-790"></A>Berkeley Software Distribution(<SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN>),&quot; a collection of programs andmodifications to the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> system. The charge:$50 for media and postage.</P><PCLASS="para">Over the next six years, in an effort funded by <SPANCLASS="acronym">ARPA</SPAN>,the so-called <SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN> <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> grewinto an operating system of its own that offered significant improvementsover AT&amp;T's. For example, a programmer using <SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN><SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> could switch between multiple programs runningat the same time. AT&amp;T's <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>allowed the names on files to be only 14 letters long, but Berkeley'sallowed names of up to 255 characters. But perhaps the most importantof the Berkeley improvements was the <SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN> 4.2<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> networking software, which made it easyto connect <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> computers to local area[5]networks (<SPANCLASS="acronym">LAN</SPAN>s). For all of these reasons, theBerkeley version of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> became very popularwith the research and academic communities.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[5] And we stress, <EMCLASS="emphasis">local</EM> area.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">About the same time, AT&amp;T had been freed from itsrestrictions on developing and marketing source code as a resultof the enforced divestiture of the phone company. Executives realizedthat they had a strong potential product in <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>,and they set about developing it into a more polished commercialproduct. This led to an interesting change in the numbering of the<SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN> releases.</P><PCLASS="para">Berkeley 4.2 <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> should have been numbered5.0. However, by the time that the 4.2 Berkeley Software Distributionwas ready to be released, friction was growing between the developersat Berkeley and the management of AT&amp;T, who owned the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>trademark and rights to the operating system. As <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>had grown in popularity, AT&amp;T executives became increasinglyworried that, with the popularity of Berkeley <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>,AT&amp;T was on the verge of losing control of a valuable propertyright. To retain control of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>, AT&amp;Tformed the <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-818"></A><SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>Support Group (<SPANCLASS="acronym">USG</SPAN>) to continue development andmarketing of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> operating system. <SPANCLASS="acronym">USG</SPAN>proceeded to christen a new version of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> asAT&amp;T <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-825"></A>System V, anddeclare it the new &quot;standard&quot;; AT&amp;T representativesreferred to <SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN> <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> as nonstandardand incompatible.</P><PCLASS="para">Under Berkeley's license with AT&amp;T, theuniversity was free to release updates to existing AT&amp;T<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> customers. But if Berkeley had decided tocall its new version of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> &quot;5.0,&quot;it would have needed to renegotiate its licensing agreement to distributethe software to other universities and companies. Thus, Berkeleyreleased <SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN> 4.2. By calling the new releaseof the operating system &quot;4.2,&quot; they pretendedthat the system was simply a minor update.</P><PCLASS="para">As interest in <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> grew, the industrywas beset by two competing versions of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>:Berkeley<SPANCLASS="acronym"> UNIX</SPAN> and AT&amp;T's SystemV. The biggest non-university proponent of Berkeley <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>was Sun Microsystems. Founded in part by graduates from Berkeley'scomputer science program, Sun's <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-838"></A>SunOS operating system was, for all practicalpurposes, Berkeley's operating system, as it was basedon <SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN> 4.1c. Many people believe that Sun'sadoption of Berkeley <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> was responsible forthe early success of the company. Another early adopter was theDigital Equipment Corporation, whose <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-842"></A>Ultrixoperating system was also quite similar to Berkeley <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>&nbsp;- not surprising as it was based on <SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN> 4.2.</P><PCLASS="para">As other companies entered the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> marketplace,they faced a question of which version of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>to adopt. On the one hand, there was Berkeley <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>,which was preferred by academics and developers, but which was &quot;unsupported&quot;and was frighteningly similar to the operating system used by Sun,soon to become the market leader. On the other hand, there was AT&amp;TSystem V <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>, which AT&amp;T, the ownerof <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>, was proclaiming as the operating system&quot;standard.&quot; As a result, most computer manufacturersthat tried to develop <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> in the mid-to-late1980s&nbsp;- including Data General, <SPANCLASS="acronym">IBM</SPAN>, HewlettPackard, and Silicon Graphics&nbsp;- adopted System V as theirstandard. A few tried to do both, coming out with systems that haddual &quot;universes.&quot; A third version of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>,called <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-855"></A>Xenix, wasdeveloped by Microsoft in the early 1980s and licensed to the SantaCruz Operation (<SPANCLASS="acronym">SCO</SPAN>). Xenix was based on AT&amp;T'solder System III operating system, although Microsoft and <SPANCLASS="acronym">SCO</SPAN>had updated it throughout the 1980s, adding some new features, butnot others.</P><PCLASS="para">As <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> started to move from the technicalto the commercial markets in the late 1980s, this conflict of operatingsystem versions was beginning to cause problems for all vendors.Commercial customers wanted a standard version of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>,hoping that it could cut training costs and guarantee software portabilityacross computers made by different vendors. And the nascent <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>applications market wanted a standard version, believing that thiswould make it easier for them to support multiple platforms, aswell as compete with the growing PC-based market.</P><PCLASS="para">The first two versions of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> to mergewere Xenix and AT&amp;T's System V. The resultingversion, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> System V/386, release3.l2, incorporated all the functionality of traditional <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>System V and Xenix. It was released in August 1988 for 80386-basedcomputers.</P><PCLASS="para">In the spring of 1988, AT&amp;T and Sun Microsystemssigned a joint development agreement to merge the two versions of<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>. The new version of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>,<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-870"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-872"></A>SystemV Release 4 (<SPANCLASS="acronym">SVR4</SPAN>), was to have the best featuresof System V and Berkeley <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> and be compatiblewith programs written for either. Sun proclaimed that it would abandonits SunOS operating system and move its entire user base over toits own version of the new operating system, which it would call<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-877"></A>Solaris.[6]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[6] Some documentationlabels the combined versions of SunOS and AT&amp;T System Vas SunOS 5.0, and uses the name Solaris to designate SunOS 5.0 withthe addition of OpenWindows and other applications.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">The rest of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> industry felt leftout and threatened by the Sun<SPANCLASS="acronym">/</SPAN>AT&amp;T announcement.Companies including <SPANCLASS="acronym">IBM</SPAN> and Hewlett-Packard worriedthat, because they were not a part of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">SVR4</SPAN>development effort, they would be at a disadvantage when the newoperating system was finally released. In May 1988, seven of theindustry's <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> leaders&nbsp;- ApolloComputer, Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, <SPANCLASS="acronym">IBM</SPAN>,and three major European computer manufacturers &nbsp;- announcedthe formation of the <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-888"></A>OpenSoftware Foundation (<SPANCLASS="acronym">OSF</SPAN>).</P><PCLASS="para">The stated purpose of <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSF</SPAN> was to wrestcontrol of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> away from AT&amp;T and putit in the hands of a not-for-profit industry coalition, which wouldbe chartered with shepherding the future development of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>and making it available to all under uniform licensing terms. <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSF</SPAN>decided to base its version of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> on <SPANCLASS="acronym">AIX</SPAN>,then moved to the <SPANCLASS="acronym">MACH</SPAN> kernel from Carnegie MellonUniversity, and an assortment of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> librariesand utilities from HP, <SPANCLASS="acronym">IBM</SPAN>, and Digital. To date,the result of this effort has not been widely adopted or embracedby all the participants. The <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSF</SPAN> operating system(<SPANCLASS="acronym">OSF</SPAN>/1) was late in coming, so somecompanies built their own (e.g., <SPANCLASS="acronym">IBM</SPAN>'s<SPANCLASS="acronym">AIX</SPAN>). Others adopted <SPANCLASS="acronym">SVR4</SPAN>after it was released, in part because it was available, and inpart because AT&amp;T and Sun went their separate ways&nbsp;- thusending the threat against which <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSF</SPAN> had beenrallied.</P><PCLASS="para">As of 1996, the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> wars are far fromsettled, but they are much less important than they seemed in theearly 1990s. In 1993, AT&amp;T sold <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>Systems Laboratories (<SPANCLASS="acronym">USL</SPAN>) to <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-911"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-913"></A>Novell, having succeeded in making <SPANCLASS="acronym">SVR4</SPAN>an industry standard, but having failed to make significant inroadsagainst Microsoft's Windows operating system on the corporatedesktop. Novell then transferred the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> trademarkto the X/Open Consortium, which is granting use of thename to systems that meet its 1170 test suite. Novell subsequentlysold ownership of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> source code to <SPANCLASS="acronym">SCO</SPAN>in 1995, effectively disbanding <SPANCLASS="acronym">USL</SPAN>.</P><PCLASS="para">Although Digital Equipment Corporation provides Digital <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>(formerly <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-922"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-924"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-926"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-928"></A><SPANCLASS="acronym">OSF</SPAN>/1)on its workstations, Digital's strongest division isn'tworkstations, but its PC division. Despite the fact that Sun'scustomers said that they wanted System V compatibility, Sun haddifficulty convincing the majority of its customers to actuallyuse its Solaris operating system during the first few years of itsrelease (and many users still complain about the switch). <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-932"></A><SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD/OS</SPAN> by <SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN>Inc., a commercial version of <SPANCLASS="acronym">BSD</SPAN> 4.4, is usedin a significant number of network firewall systems, <SPANCLASS="acronym">VAR</SPAN>systems, and academic research labs. Meanwhile, a free <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>-likeoperating system&nbsp;- <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-939"></A>Linux&nbsp;- hastaken the hobbyist and small-business market by storm.

Users who become familiar with <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>tend to become very attached to the openness and flexibility ofthe system. The client-server model of computing has also becomequite popular in business environments, and <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>systems support this paradigm well (and there have not been toomany other choices).</P><PCLASS="para">Furthermore, a set of standards for a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>-likeoperating system (including interface, library, and behavioral characteristics)has emerged, although considerable variability among implementationsremains. This set of standards is <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-966"></A><SPANCLASS="acronym">POSIX</SPAN>,originally initiated by <SPANCLASS="acronym">IEEE</SPAN>, but also adoptedas <SPANCLASS="acronym">ISO/IEC</SPAN> 9945. People can now buy differentmachines from different vendors, and still have a common interface.Efforts are also focused on putting the same interface on <SPANCLASS="acronym">VMS</SPAN>,Windows NT, and other platforms quite different from <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>&quot;under the hood.&quot; Today's <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>is based on many such standards, and this greatly increases itsattractiveness as a common platform base in business and academiaalike. <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> vendors and users are the leadersof the &quot;open systems&quot; movement: without <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>,the very concept of &quot;open systems&quot; would probablynot exist. No longer do computer purchases lock a customer intoa multi-decade relationship with a single vendor.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-976"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_02.htm"TITLE="1.2 What Is an Operating System?"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 1.2 What Is an Operating System?"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_04.htm"TITLE="1.4 Security and UNIX"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 1.4 Security and UNIX"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">1.2 What Is an Operating System?</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">1.4 Security and UNIX</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
