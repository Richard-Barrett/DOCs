That's the goalof this book. If we can provide information to users and administratorsin a way that helps them understand the way things work and howto use the safeguards, then we should be moving in the right direction.After all, these areas seem to be where many of the problems originate.</P><PCLASS="para">Unfortunately, knowing how things work on the system is notenough. Because of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> design, a singleflaw in a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> system program can compromisethe security of the operating system as a whole. This is why vigilanceand attention are needed to keep a system running securely: aftera hole is discovered, it must be fixed. Furthermore, in this ageof networked computing, that fix must be made widely available,lest some users who have not updated their software fall victimto more up-to-date attackers.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="note"><PCLASS="para"><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Although this book includes numerous examples of pastsecurity holes in the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> operating system,we have intentionally not provided the reader with an exhaustivelist of the means by which a machine can be penetrated. Not onlywould such information not necessarily help to improve the securityof your system, but it might place a number of systems running olderversions of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> at additional risk.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Even properly configured <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> systems arestill very susceptible to <ICLASS="firstterm"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1190"></A>denial of service</I> attacks, whereone user can make the system unusable for everyone else by &quot;hogging&quot;a resource or degrading system performance. In most circumstances,however, administrators can track down the person who is causingthe interruption of service and deal with that person directly.We'll talk about denial of service attacks in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch25_01.htm"TITLE="Denial of Service Attacks and Solutions">Chapter 25, <CITECLASS="chapter">Denial of Service Attacks and Solutions</CITE></A>.</P><PCLASS="para">First of all, we start by discussing basic issues of policyand risk in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch02_01.htm"TITLE="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2</A>. Before you start settingpermissions and changing passwords, make sure you understand whatyou are protecting and why. You should also understand what youare protecting against. Although we can't tell you allof that, we can outline some of the questions you need to answerbefore you design your overall security plan.</P><PCLASS="para">Throughout the rest of the book, we'll be explaining<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> structures and mechanisms that can affectyour overall security. We concentrate on the fundamentals of theway the system behaves so you can understand the basic principlesand apply them in your own environment. We have specifically <EMCLASS="emphasis">not</EM>presented examples and suggestions of where changes in the sourcecode can fix problems or add security. Although we know of manysuch fixes, most <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> sites do not have accessto source code. Most system administrators do not have the necessaryexpertise to make the required changes. Furthermore, source codechanges, as do configurations. A fix that is appropriate in March1996 may not be desirable on a version of the operating system shippedthe following September. Instead, we present principles, with thehope that they will give you better long-term results than one-timecustom modifications.</P><PCLASS="para">We suggest that you keep in mind that even if you take everythingto heart that we explain in the following chapters, and even ifyou keep a vigilant watch over your systems, you may still not fullyprotect your assets. You need to educate every one of your usersabout good security and convince them to practice what they learn.Computer security is a lonely, frustrating occupation if it is practicedas a case of &quot;us&quot; (information security personnel)versus &quot;them&quot; (the rest of the users). If youcan practice security as &quot;all of us&quot; (everyonein the organization) versus &quot;them&quot; (people whowould breach our security), the process will be much easier. Youalso need to help convince vendors to produce safer code. If weall put our money behind our stated concerns, maybe the vendorswill finally catch on.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_04.htm"TITLE="1.4 Security and UNIX"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 1.4 Security and UNIX"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="CHAPTER"HREF="ch02_01.htm"TITLE="2.
