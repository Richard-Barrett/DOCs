You can spend an unlimited amount oftime, money, and effort on computer security, but you will neverquite solve the problem of accidental data loss or intentional disruptionof your activities. Given the right set of circumstances&nbsp;- softwarebugs, accidents, mistakes, bad luck, bad weather, or a motivatedand well-equipped attacker&nbsp;- any computer can be compromised,rendered useless, or worse.</P><PCLASS="para">The job of the security professional is to help organizationsdecide how much time and money need to be spent on security. Anotherpart of that job is to make sure that organizations have policies,guidelines, and procedures in place so that the money spent is spentwell. And finally, the professional needs to audit the system toensure that the appropriate controls are implemented correctly toachieve the policy's goals. Thus, practical security isreally a question of management and administration more than itis one of technical skill. Consequently, security must be a priorityof your firm's management.</P><PCLASS="para">This book divides the process of security planning into sixdiscrete steps:</P><OLCLASS="orderedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Security needs planning</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Risk assessment</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Cost-benefit analysis</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Creating policies to reflect your needs</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Implementation</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Audit and incident response</P></LI></OL><PCLASS="para">This chapter covers security planning, risk assessment, cost-benefitanalysis, and policy-making. Implementation is covered by many ofthe chapters of this book.

Security concerns and awarenessby the users are important, but they cannot build or sustain aneffective culture of security. Instead, the head(s) of the organizationmust treat security as important, and abide by all the same rulesand regulations as everyone else.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Effective computer security means protecting <EMCLASS="emphasis">information</EM>.All plans, policies and procedures should reflect the need to protectinformation in whatever form it takes. Proprietary data does notbecome worthless when it is on a printout or is faxed to anothersite instead of contained in a disk file. Customer confidentialinformation does not suddenly lose its value because it is recitedon the phone between two users instead of contained within an emailmessage. The information should be protected no matter what itsform.</P></LI></UL><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-1">2.1 Planning Your Security Needs</A></H2><PCLASS="para">A computer is secure if it behaves the way that you expectit will.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1241"></A>There are many different kindsof computer security, and many different definitions. Rather thanpresent a formal definition, this book takes the practical approachand discusses the categories of protection you should consider.We believe that secure computers are usable computers, and, likewise,that computers that cannot be used, for whatever the reason, arenot very secure.</P><PCLASS="para">Within this broad definition, there are many different kindsof security that both users and administrators of computer systemsneed to be concerned about:</P><DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term">Confidentiality </DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1249"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1251"></A>Protectinginformation from being read or copied by anyone who has not beenexplicitly authorized by the owner of that information. This typeof security includes not only protecting the information in toto,but also protecting individual pieces of information that may seemharmless by themselves but that can be used to infer other confidentialinformation.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term">Data integrity </DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1258"></A>Protecting information(including programs) from being deleted or altered in any way withoutthe permission of the owner of that information. Information tobe protected also includes items such as accounting records, backuptapes, file creation times, and documentation.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term">Availability </DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1264"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1267"></A>Protecting your services so they'renot degraded or made unavailable (crashed) without authorization.If the system is unavailable when an authorized user needs it, theresult can be as bad as having the information that resides on thesystem deleted.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term">Consistency </DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1274"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1276"></A>Making sure that the system behaves as expected bythe authorized users. If software or hardware suddenly starts behavingradically differently from the way it used to behave, especiallyafter an upgrade or a bug fix, a disaster could occur. Imagine ifyour <ICLASS="filename">ls</I> command occasionally deleted filesinstead of listing them! This type of security can also be consideredas ensuring the <EMCLASS="emphasis">correctness</EM> of the data andsoftware you use.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term">Control </DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1285"></A>Regulatingaccess to your system. If unknown and unauthorized individuals (orsoftware) are found on your system, they can create a big problem.You must worry about how they got in, what they might have done,and who or what else has also accessed your system. Recovering fromsuch episodes can require considerable time and expense for rebuildingand reinstalling your system, and verifying that nothing importanthas been changed or disclosed&nbsp;- even if nothing actuallyhappened.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term">Audit </DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1291"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1294"></A>As well as worrying about unauthorized users,authorized users sometimes make mistakes, or even commit maliciousacts. In such cases, you need to determine what was done, by whom,and what was affected. The only way to achieve these results isby having some incorruptible record of activity on your system thatpositively identifies the actors and actions involved. In some criticalapplications, the audit trail may be extensive enough to allow &quot;undo&quot;operations to help restore the system to a correct state.</P></DD></DL><PCLASS="para">Although all of these aspects of security above are important,different organizations will view each with a different amount ofimportance. This variance is because different organizations havedifferent security concerns, and must set their priorities and policiesaccordingly. For example:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">In a <EMCLASS="emphasis">banking environment</EM>,integrity and auditability are usually the most critical concerns,while confidentiality and availability are the next in importance.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">In a <EMCLASS="emphasis">national defense-related system thatprocesses classified information</EM>, confidentiality maycome first, and availability last.[1]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] In some highlyclassified environments, officials would prefer to blow up a buildingrather than allow an attacker to gain access to the informationcontained within that building's walls.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">In a <EMCLASS="emphasis">university</EM>, integrityand availability may be the most important requirements. The priorityis that students be able to work on their papers, rather than trackingthe precise times that students accessed their accounts.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">If you are a security administrator, you need to thoroughlyunderstand the needs of your operational environment and users.You then need to define your procedures accordingly. Not everythingwe describe in this book will be appropriate in every environment.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-1.1">2.1.1 Trust</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1314"></A>Security professionals generallydon't refer to a computer system as being &quot;secure&quot;or &quot;unsecure.&quot;[2] Instead, we use theword &quot;trust&quot; to describe our level of confidencethat a computer system will behave as expected. This acknowledgesthat absolute security can never be present. We can only try toapproach it by developing enough trust in the overall configurationto warrant using it for critical applications.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[2] We use the term<EMCLASS="emphasis">unsecure</EM> to mean having weak security, and<EMCLASS="emphasis">insecure</EM> to describe the state of mind of peoplerunning unsecure systems.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Developing adequate trust in your computer systems requirescareful thought and planning. Decisions should be based on soundpolicy decisions and risk analysis. In the remainder of this chapter,we&quot;ll discuss the general procedure for creating workablesecurity plans and policies. The topic is too big, however, forus to provide an in-depth treatment:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If you are at a company, university,or government agency, we suggest that you contact your internalaudit and/or risk management department for additionalhelp (they may already have some plans and policies in place thatyou should know about).

Forexample, many large accounting and audit firms now have teams ofprofessionals that can evaluate the security of computer installations.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If you are with a smaller institution or are dealingwith a personal machine, you may decide that we cover these issuesin greater detail than you actually need.
