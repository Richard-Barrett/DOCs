This is called a <EMCLASS="emphasis">cost-benefit analysis.</EM></P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-3.1">2.3.1 The Cost of Loss</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1506"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1508"></A>Computingcosts can be very difficult. A simple cost calculation can simplytake into account the cost of repairing or replacing a particularitem. A more sophisticated cost calculation can consider the costof having equipment out of service, the cost of added training,the cost of additional procedures resulting from a loss, the costto a company's reputation, and even the cost to a company'sclients. Generally speaking, including more factors in your costcalculation will increase your effort, but will also increase theaccuracy of your calculations.</P><PCLASS="para">For most purposes, you do not need to assign an exact valueto each possible risk. Normally, assigning a cost range to eachitem is sufficient. For instance, the loss of a dozen blank diskettesmay be classed as &quot;under $500,&quot; whilea destructive fire in your computer room might be classed as &quot;over$1,000,000.&quot; Some items may actually fall intothe category &quot;irreparable/irreplaceable;&quot;this could include loss of your entire accounts-due database, orthe death of a key employee.</P><PCLASS="para">You may want to assign these costs based on a finer scaleof loss than simply &quot;lost/not lost.&quot;For instance, you might want to assign separate costs for each ofthe following categories (these are not in rank order):</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Non-availability over a short term(&lt; 7-10 days)</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Non-availability over a medium term (1-2weeks)</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Non-availability over a long term (more than 2 weeks)</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Permanent loss or destruction</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Accidental partial loss or damage</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Deliberate partial loss or damage</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Unauthorized disclosure within the organization</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Unauthorized disclosure to some outsiders</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Unauthorized full disclosure to outsiders, competitors,and the press</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Replacement or recovery cost</P></LI></UL></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-3.2">2.3.2 The Cost of Prevention</A></H3><PCLASS="para">Finally, you need to calculate the cost of preventing eachkind of loss.</P><PCLASS="para">For instance, the cost to recover from a momentary power failureis probably only that of personnel &quot;downtime&quot;and the time necessary to reboot. However, the cost of preventionmay be that of buying and installing a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UPS</SPAN> system.</P><PCLASS="para">Costs need to be amortized over the expected lifetime of yourapproaches, as appropriate. Deriving these costs may reveal secondarycosts and credits that should also be factored in. For instance,installing a better fire-suppression system may result in a yearlydecrease in your fire insurance premiums and give you a tax benefitfor capital depreciation. But spending money on a fire-suppressionsystem means that the money is not available for other purposes,such as increased employee training, or even investing.t</P><DIVCLASS="sidebar"><H4CLASS="sidebar"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-1539">Cost-Benefit Examples</A></H4><PCLASS="para">For example, suppose you have a 0.5% chance of asingle power outage lasting more than a few seconds in any givenyear. The expected loss as a result of personnel not being ableto work is $25,000, and the cost of recovery (handlingreboots and disk checks) is expected to be another $10,000in downtime and personnel costs. Thus, the expected loss and recoverycost per year is (25000+10000) x .005 = $175.If the cost of a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UPS</SPAN> system that can handle allyour needs is $150,000 and it has an expected lifetimeof ten years, then the cost of avoidance is $15,000 peryear. Clearly, investing in a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UPS</SPAN> system at thislocation is not cost-effective.</P><PCLASS="para">As another example, suppose that compromise of a passwordby any employee could result in an outsider gaining access to tradesecret information worth $1,000,000. There is no recoverypossible, because the trade secret status would be compromised,and once lost cannot be regained. You have 50 employees who accessyour network while traveling, and the probability of any one ofthem accidentally disclosing the password (for example, having it&quot;sniffed&quot; over the Internet; see <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Defending  Your Accounts">Chapter 8, <CITECLASS="chapter">Defending  Your Accounts</CITE></A>)is 2%. Thus, the probability of at least one password beingdisclosed during the year is 63.6%.[4] The expected loss is (1000000+0)x .636 = $636,000. If the cost of avoidance isbuying a $75 one-time password card for each user (see<ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Defending  Your Accounts">Chapter 8</A>), plus a $20,000 software cost, andthe system is good for five years, then the avoidance cost is (50*75+ 20000) / 5 = $4750 per year.Buying such a system would clearly be indicated.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[4] Thatis, 1- (1.0-0.02)50</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-3.3">2.3.3 Adding Up the Numbers</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1552"></A>Atthe conclusion of this exercise, you should have a multi-dimensionalmatrix consisting of assets, risks, and possible losses. For eachloss, you should know its probability, the predicted loss, and theamount of money required to defend against the loss. If you arevery precise, you will also have a probability that your defensewill prove inadequate.</P><PCLASS="para">The process of determining if each defense should or shouldnot be employed is now straightforward. You do this by multiplyingeach expected loss by the probability of its occurring as a resultof each threat. Sort these in descending order, and compare eachcost of occurrence to its cost of defense.</P><PCLASS="para">This comparison results in a prioritized list of things youshould address. The list may be surprising. Your goal should beto avoid expensive, probable losses, before worrying about lesslikely, low-damage threats. <EMCLASS="emphasis">In many environments, fireand loss of key personnel are much more likely to occur and moredamaging than a virus or break-in over the network</EM>. Surprisingly,however, it is break-ins and viruses that seem to occupy the attentionand budget of most managers. This practice is simply not cost effective,nor does it provide the highest levels of trust in your overallsystem.</P><PCLASS="para">To figure out what you should do, take the figures that youhave gathered for avoidance and recovery to determine how best toaddress your high-priority items. The way to do this is to add thecost of recovery to the expected average loss, and multiply thatby the probability of occurrence. Then, compare the final productwith the yearly cost of avoidance. If the cost of avoidance is lowerthan the risk you are defending against, you would be advised toinvest in the avoidance strategy if you have sufficient financialresources. If the cost of avoidance is higher than the risk thatyou are defending against, then consider doing nothing until afterother threats have been dealt <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1559"></A>with.[5]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[5] Alternatively, you may wish to reconsider your costs.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><DIVCLASS="sidebar"><H4CLASS="sidebar"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-1564">Risk Cannot Be Eliminated</A></H4><PCLASS="para">You can identify and reduce risks, but you can never eliminate riskentirely.</P><PCLASS="para">For example, you may purchase a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UPS</SPAN>to reduce the risk of a power failure damaging your data. But the<SPANCLASS="acronym">UPS</SPAN> may fail when you need it. The power interruptionmay outlast your battery capacity. The cleaning crew may have unpluggedit last week to use the outlet for their floor polisher.</P><PCLASS="para">A careful risk assessment will identify these <EMCLASS="emphasis">secondaryrisks </EM>and help you to plan for them as well. You might,for instance, purchase a second <SPANCLASS="acronym">UPS</SPAN>. But, ofcourse, both of those units could fail at the same time. There mighteven be an interaction between the two units that you did not foreseewhen you installed them. The likelihood of a power failure getssmaller and smaller as you buy more backup power supplies and testthe system, but it never becomes zero.</P><PCLASS="para">Risk assessmentcan help you to protect yourself and your organization against humanrisks as well as natural ones. For example, you can use risk assessmentto help protect yourself against computer break-ins, by identifyingthe risks and planning accordingly. But, as with power failures,you cannot completely eliminate the chance of someone breaking into your computer.</P><PCLASS="para">This fact is fundamental to computersecurity: No matter how secure you make a computer, it can alwaysbe broken into given sufficient resources, time, motivation, andmoney.</P><PCLASS="para">Even systems that are certified according tothe Department of Defense's &quot;<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1576"></A>Orange Book&quot; are vulnerable to break-ins.One reason is that these systems are sometimes not administeredcorrectly. Another reason is that some people using them may bewilling to take bribes to violate the security. Computer accesscontrols do no good if they're not administered properly,exactly as the lock on a building will do no good if it is the nightwatchman who is stealing office equipment at 2 a.m.</P><PCLASS="para">Indeed,people are often the weakest link in a security system. The mostsecure computer system in the world is wide open if the system administratorcooperates with those who wish to break into the machine. Peoplecan be compromised with money, threats, or ideological appeals.People can also make mistakes&nbsp;- like accidentally sendingemail containing account passwords to the wrong person.</P><PCLASS="para">Indeed,people are usually cheaper and easier to compromise than advancedtechnological safeguards.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-3.4">2.3.4 Convincing Management</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1583"></A>Security is notfree. The more elaborate your security measures become, the moreexpensive they become. Systems that are more secure may also bemore difficult to use, although this need not always be the case.[6]Security can also get in the way of &quot;power users,&quot;who wish to exercise many difficult and sometimes dangerous operationswithout authentication or accountability. Some of these power userscan be politically powerful within your organization.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[6] The converse is also not true. PC operating systems are notsecure, even though some are difficult to use.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">After you have completed your risk assessment and cost-benefitanalysis, you will need to convince your organization'smanagement of the need to act upon the information. Normally, youwould formulate a policy that is then officially adopted. Frequently,this process is an uphill battle. Fortunately, it does not haveto be.</P><PCLASS="para">The goal of risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis is toprioritize your actions and spending on security. If your businessplan is such that you should not have an uninsured risk of morethan $10,000 per year, you can use your risk analysis todetermine what needs to be spent to achieve this goal. Your analysiscan also be a guide as to what to do first, then second, and canidentify which things you should relegate to later years.</P><PCLASS="para">Another benefit of risk assessment is that it helps to justifyto management that you need additional resources for security. Mostmanagers and directors know little about computers, but they dounderstand risk and cost/benefit analyses.[7] If you can show thatyour organization is currently facing an exposure to risk that couldtotal $20,000,000 per year (add up all the expected lossesplus recovery costs for what is currently in place), then this estimatemight help convince management to fund some additional personneland resources.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[7] Inlike manner, few computer security personnel seem to understandrisk analysis techniques.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">On the other hand, going to management with a vague &quot;We'rereally likely to see several break-ins on the Internet after thenext <SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT</SPAN> announcement&quot; is unlikelyto produce anything other than a mild concern (if that).<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1594"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1596"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1598"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1600"></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_02.htm"TITLE="2.2 Risk Assessment"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 2.2 Risk Assessment"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_04.htm"TITLE="2.4 Policy"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 2.4 Policy"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.2 Risk Assessment</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.4 Policy</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
