Youcould write a very simple, general policy of a few pages that coversmost possibilities. You could also craft a policy for differentsets of assets: a policy for email, a policy for personnel data,and a policy on accounting information. A third approach, takenby many large corporations, is to have a small, simple policy augmentedwith standards and guidelines for appropriate behavior. We'llbriefly outline this latter approach, with the reader'sunderstanding that simpler policies can be crafted; more informationis given in the references.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-4.1">2.4.1 The Role of Policy</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1610"></A>Policy playsthree major roles. First, it makes clear what is being protectedand why. Second, it clearly states the responsibility for that protection.Third, it provides a ground on which to interpret and resolve anylater conflicts that might arise. What the policy should <EMCLASS="emphasis">not</EM>do is list specific threats, machines, or individuals by name&nbsp;- thepolicy should be general and change little over time. For example:</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="blockquote"><PCLASS="para">Information and information processing facilitiesare a critical resource for the Big Whammix Corporation. Informationshould be protected commensurate with its value to Big Whammix,and consistent with applicable law. All employees share in the responsibilityfor the protection and supervision of information that is produced,manipulated, received, or transmitted in their departments. Allemployees likewise share in the responsibility for the maintenance,proper operation, and protection of all information processing resourcesof Big Whammix.</P><PCLASS="para">Information to be protected is any information discovered,learned, derived, or handled during the course of business thatis not generally known outside of Big Whammix. This includes tradesecret information (ours, and that of other organizations and companies),patent disclosure information, personnel data, financial information,information about any business opportunities, and anything elsethat conveys an advantage to Big Whammix so long as it is not disclosed.Personal information about employees, customers, and vendors isalso to be considered confidential and protectable.</P><PCLASS="para">All information at Big Whammix, however stored&nbsp;- oncomputer media, on printouts, in microfilm, on CD-<SPANCLASS="acronym">ROM</SPAN>,on audio or video tape, on photographic media, or in any other stored,tangible form&nbsp;- is the responsibility of the Chief InformationHoncho (<SPANCLASS="acronym">CIH</SPAN>). Thus, Big Whammix facilities shouldbe used only for functions related to the business of Big Whammix,as determined by the President. The <SPANCLASS="acronym">CIH</SPAN> shallbe responsible for the protection of all information and informationprocessing capabilities belonging to Big Whammix, whether locatedon company property or not. He will have authority to act commensuratewith this responsibility, with the approval of the President ofBig Whammix. The <SPANCLASS="acronym">CIH</SPAN> shall formulate appropriatestandards and guidelines, according to good business practice, toensure the protection and continued operation of information processing.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Key to note in this example policy is the definition of whatis to be protected, who is responsible for protecting it, and whois charged with creating additional guidelines. This policy canbe shown to all employees, and to outsiders to explain company policy.It should remain current no matter what operating system is in use,or who the <SPANCLASS="acronym">CIH</SPAN> may happen to be.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-4.2">2.4.2 Standards</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1627"></A>Standards areintended to codify successful practice of security in an organization.They are generally phrased in terms of &quot;shall.&quot;Standards are generally platform independent, and at least implya metric to determine if they have been met. Standards are developedin support of policy, and change slowly over time. Standards mightcover such issues as how to screen new hires, how long to keep backups,and how to test <SPANCLASS="acronym">UPS</SPAN> systems.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1632"></A>Forexample, consider a standard for backups. It might state:</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="blockquote"><PCLASS="para">Backups shall be made of all online data and softwareon a regular basis. In no case will backups be done any less oftenthan once every 72 hours of normal business operation. All backupsshould be kept for a period of at least six months; the first backupin January and July of each year will be kept indefinitely at anoff-site, secured storage location. At least one full backup ofthe entire system shall be taken every other week. All backup mediawill meet accepted industry standards for its type, to be readableafter a minimum of five years in unattended storage.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">This standard does not name a particular backup mechanismor software package. It clearly states, however, what is to be stored,how long it is to be stored, and how often it is to be made.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1639"></A>Considera possible standard for authentication:</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="blockquote"><PCLASS="para">Every user account on each multiuser machine shallhave only one person authorized to use it. That user will be requiredto authenticate his or her identity to the system using some positiveproof of identity. This proof of identity can be through the useof an approved authentication token or smart card, an approved one-timepassword mechanism, or an approved biometric unit. Reusable passwordswill not be used for primary authentication on any machine thatis ever connected to a network or modem, that is portable and carriedoff company property, or that is used outside of a private office.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-4.3">2.4.3 Guidelines</A></H3><PCLASS="para">Guidelines are the &quot;should&quot; statements inpolicies. The intent of guidelines is to interpret standards fora particular environment&nbsp;- whether that is a software environment,or a physical environment. Unlike standards, guidelines may be violated,if necessary. As the name suggests, guidelines are not usually usedas standards of performance, but as ways to help guide behavior.</P><PCLASS="para">Here is a typical guideline for backups:</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="blockquote"><PCLASS="para">Backups on <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>-based machinesshould be done with the &quot;dump&quot; program. Backupsshould be done nightly, in single-user mode, for systems that arenot in 24-hour production use. Backups for systems in 24-hour productionmode should be made at the shift change closest to midnight, whenthe system is less loaded. All backups will be read and verifiedimmediately after being written.</P><PCLASS="para">Level 0 dumps will be done for the first backup in Januaryand July. Level 3 backups should be done on the 1st and 15th ofevery month. Level 5 backups should be done every Monday and Thursdaynight, unless a level 0 or level 3 backup is done on that day. Level7 backups should be done every other night except on holidays.</P><PCLASS="para">Once per week, the administrator will pick a file at randomfrom some backup made that week. The operator will be required torecover that file as a test of the backup procedures.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1653"></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Guidelines tend to be very specific to particular architecturesand even to specific machines. Guidelines also tend to change moreoften than do standards, to reflect changing conditions.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-4.4">2.4.4 Some Key Ideas in Developing a Workable Policy</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1660"></A>Therole of policy (and associated standards and guidelines) is to helpprotect those items you (collectively) view as important. They donot need to be overly specific and complicated in most instances.Sometimes, a simple policy statement is sufficient for your environment,as in the following example.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="blockquote"><PCLASS="para">The use and protection of this system is everyone'sresponsibility. Only do things you would want everyone else to do,too. Respect the privacy of other users. If you find a problem,fix it yourself or report it right away. Abide by all applicablelaws concerning use of the system. Be responsible for what you doand always identify yourself. Have fun!</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Other times, a more formal policy, reviewed by a law firmand various security consultants, is the way you need to go to protectyour assets. Each organization will be different. We know of someorganizations that have volumes of policies, standards, and guidelinesfor their <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> systems.</P><PCLASS="para">There are some key ideas to your policy formation, though,that need to be mentioned more explicitly. These are in additionto the two we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.</P><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-4.4.1">2.4.4.1 Assign an owner</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1671"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1674"></A>Everypiece of information and equipment to be protected should have anassigned &quot;owner.&quot; The owner is the person whois responsible for the information, including its copying, destruction,backups, and other aspects of protection. This is also the personwho has some authority with respect to granting access to the information.</P><PCLASS="para">The problem with security in many environments is that thereis important information that has no clear owner. As a result, usersare never sure who makes decisions about the storage of the information,or who regulates access to the information. Information sometimeseven disappears without anyone noticing for a long period of timebecause there is no &quot;owner&quot; to contact or monitorthe situation.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-4.4.2">2.4.4.2 Be positive</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1680"></A>People respond better topositive statements than to negative ones. Instead of building longlists of &quot;don't do this&quot; statements,think how to phrase the same information positively. The abbreviatedpolicy statement above could have been written as a set of &quot;don'ts&quot;as follows, but consider how much better it read originally:</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="blockquote"><PCLASS="para">It's your responsibility not to allowmisuse of the system. Don't do things you wouldn'twant others to do, too. Don't violate the privacy of others.If you find a problem, don't keep it a secret if you can'tfix it yourself. Don't violate any laws concerning useof the system. Don't try to shift responsibility for whatyou do to someone else and don't hide your identity. Don'thave a bad time!</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-4.4.3">2.4.4.3 Remember that employees are people too</A></H4><PCLASS="para">When writing policies, keep users in mind. They will makemistakes, and they will misunderstand. The policy should not suggestthat users will be thrown to the wolves if an error occurs.</P><PCLASS="para">Furthermore, consider that information systems may containinformation about users that they would like to keep somewhat private.This may include some email, personnel records, and job evaluations.This material should be protected, too, although you may not beable to guarantee absolute privacy. Be considerate of users'needs and feelings.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-4.4.4">2.4.4.4 Concentrate on education</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1691"></A>You wouldbe wise to include standards for training and retraining of allusers. Every user should have basic security awareness education,with some form of periodic refresher material (even if the refresheronly involves being given a copy of this book!). Trained and educatedusers are less likely to fall for scams and social engineering attacks.They are also more likely to be happy about security measures ifthey understand why they are in place.</P><PCLASS="para">A crucial part of any security system is giving staff timeand support for additional training and education. There are alwaysnew tools and new threats, new techniques, and new information tobe learned. If staff members are spending 60 hours each week chasingdown phantom PC viruses and doing backups, they will not be as effectiveas staff given a few weeks of training time each year. Furthermore,they are more likely to be happy with their work if they are givena chance to grow and learn on the job, and are allowed to spendevenings and weekends with their families instead of trying to catchup on installing software and making backups.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-2-SECT-4.4.5">2.4.4.5 Have authority commensurate with responsibility</A></H4><DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1700"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1702"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1704"></A>Spaf'sfirst principle of security administration: </DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis">If you have responsibility for security,but have no authority to set rules or punish violators, your ownrole in the organization is to take the blame when something biggoes wrong.</EM></P></DD></DL><PCLASS="para">Consider the case we heard about in which a system administratorcaught one of the programmers trying to break into the root accountof the payroll system.
