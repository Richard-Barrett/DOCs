Two common and related ways todo this are by trying many possible passwords from a database ofcommon passwords, and by stealing a copy of your organization'spassword file and trying to <ICLASS="firstterm">crack</I> the encryptedpasswords that it contains.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] Another part of your first line ofdefense is physical security, which may prevent an attacker fromsimply carting your server through the lobby without being questioned.See <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch12_01.htm"TITLE="Physical Security">Chapter 12, <CITECLASS="chapter">Physical Security</CITE></A> for details.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">After an attacker gains initial access, he or she is freeto snoop around, looking for other security holes to exploit toattain successively higher privileges. The best way to keep yoursystem secure is to keep unauthorized users out of the system inthe first place. This means teaching your users what good passwordsecurity means and making sure they adhere to good security practices.</P><PCLASS="para">Sometimes even good passwords aren't sufficient.This is especially true in cases where passwords need to travelacross unprotected networks. With default network protocols anddefenses, these passwords may be <ICLASS="firstterm"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1891"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1894"></A>sniffed</I>&nbsp;- readfrom the network by someone not authorized to know the passwords.In cases of this kind, one-time passwords are necessary.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-3-SECT-1">3.1 Usernames</A></H2><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1899"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1901"></A>Everyperson who uses a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> computer should have an<ICLASS="filename">account</I>. An account is identified by a <ICLASS="firstterm">username.</I>Traditionally, each account also has a secret <ICLASS="firstterm">password</I> associated with it to prevent unauthorized use. Usernamesare sometimes called <ICLASS="firstterm"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1908"></A>account names</I>. You needto know both your username and your password to log into a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>system. For example, Rachel Cohen has an account on her university'scomputer system. Her username is rachel. Her password is &quot;Iluvfred.&quot;When she wants to log into the university's computer system,she types:</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="screen"><PRECLASS="screen">login: rachelpassword: Iluvfred</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">The username is an <ICLASS="firstterm"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1916"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1918"></A>identifier:</I> it tells the computer who you are. The password is an<ICLASS="filename">authenticator</I>: you use it to prove to the operatingsystem that you are who you claim to be.</P><PCLASS="para">Standard <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> usernames may be betweenone and eight characters long. Within a single <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>computer, usernames must be unique: no two users can have the sameone. (If two people did have the same username, then they wouldreally be sharing the same account.) <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> passwordsare also between one and eight characters long, although some commercial<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> systems now allow longer passwords. Longerpasswords are usually more secure because they are harder to guess.More than one user can theoretically have the same password, althoughif they do, that indicates that <EMCLASS="emphasis">both</EM> usershave picked a bad password.</P><PCLASS="para">A single person can have more than one <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>account on the same computer. In this case, each account would haveits own username. A username can be any sequence of characters youwant (with some exceptions), and does not necessarily correspondto a real person's name.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1929"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1931"></A></P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="note"><PCLASS="para"><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Some versions of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> have problemswith usernames that do not start with a lowercase letter or thatcontain special characters such as punctuation or control characters.Usernames containing certain unusual characters will also causeproblems for various application programs, including some networkmail programs. For this reason, many sites allow only usernamesthat contain lowercase letters and numbers and that start with alowercase letter.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Your username identifies you to<SPANCLASS="acronym"> UNIX </SPAN>thesame way your first name identifies you to your friends. When youlog into the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX </SPAN>system, you tell it your usernamethe same way you might say, &quot;Hello, this is Sabrina,&quot;when you pick up the telephone.[2]When somebody sends you electronic mail, they send it addressedwith your username. For this reason, organizations that have morethan one computer often require people to have the same usernameon every machine, primarily to minimize confusion with electronicmail.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[2] Even if you aren'tSabrina, saying that you are Sabrina identifies you as Sabrina.Of course, if you are not Sabrina, your voice will probably not<ICLASS="firstterm">authenticate</I> you as Sabrina, provided thatthe person you are speaking with knows what Sabrina sounds like.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">There is considerable flexibility in choosing a username.For example, John Q. Random might have any of the following usernames;they are all potentially valid:</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="screen"><PRECLASS="screen">john johnqr johnr jqr jqrandom jrandom random randomjq</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Alternatively, John might have a username that appears totallyunrelated to his real name, like <ICLASS="systemitem.username">avocado</I>or <ICLASS="systemitem.username">t42</I>. Having a usernamesimilar to your own name is merely a matter of convenience.</P><PCLASS="para">Most organizations require that usernames be at least threecharacters long. Usernames that are only one or two characters arevalid, but they are usually discouraged. Single-character usernamesare simply too confusing for most people to deal with, no matterhow easy you might think it would be to be user &quot;i&quot;or &quot;x&quot;. Usernames that are two characters longare easily confused between different sites: is <ACLASS="email"HREF="mailto:mg@unipress.com">mg@unipress.com</A> the same personas <ACLASS="email"HREF="mailto:mg@aol.com">mg@aol.com</A>? Nameswith little intrinsic meaning, such as <ICLASS="systemitem.username">t42</I>and <ICLASS="systemitem.username">xp9uu6wl</I>, can alsocause confusion, because they are more difficult for correspondentsto remember.</P><PCLASS="para">Some organizations assign usernames consisting of a person'slast name (sometimes with an optional initial). Other organizationslet users pick their own names. A few organizations and online servicesassign an apparently random string of characters as the usernames,although this is not often popular with users or their correspondents:user <ICLASS="systemitem.username">xp9uu6wl</I> may getquite annoyed at continually getting mail misaddressed for <ICLASS="systemitem.username">xp9uu6wi</I>, assuming that anyonecan remember either username at all.</P><PCLASS="para"><SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> also has special accounts which areused for administrative purposes and special system functions. Theseaccounts are not normally used by individual users, as you willsee shortly. <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1957"></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="PART"HREF="part02.htm"TITLE="II.
