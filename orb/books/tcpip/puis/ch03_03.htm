In classical security parlance, your passwordis what the computer uses to <EMCLASS="emphasis">authenticate</EM> your<EMCLASS="emphasis">identity</EM> (two words that have a lot of significanceto security gurus, but generally mean the same thing that they doto ordinary people).</P><PCLASS="para">When you log in, you tell the computer who you are by typingyour username at the login prompt. You then type your password (inresponse to the password prompt) to prove that you are who you claimto be. For example:</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="screen"><PRECLASS="screen">login: sarahpassword: <ICLASS="systemitem.password">tuna4fis</I></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">As we mentioned above, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> does not displayyour password when you type it.</P><PCLASS="para">If <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2219"></A>thepassword that you supply with your username corresponds to the oneon file, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> logs you in and gives you fullaccess to all of your files, commands, and devices. If either thepassword or the username does not match, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>does not log you in.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2225"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2228"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2230"></A>On some versions of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>,if somebody tries to log into your account and supplies an invalidpassword several times in succession, your account will be locked.A locked account can be unlocked only by the system administrator.Locking has two functions:</P><OLCLASS="orderedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">It protects the system from someonewho persists in trying to guess a password; before they can guessthe correct password, the account is shut down.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">It notifies you that someone has been trying tobreak into your account.</P></LI></OL><PCLASS="para">If you find yourself locked out of your account, you shouldcontact your system administrator and get your password changedto something new. Don't change your password back to whatit was before you were locked out.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="note"><PCLASS="para"><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> The automatic lockout feature can prevent unauthorizeduse, but it can also be used to conduct <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2242"></A>denial of service attacks,or by an attacker to lock selected users out of the system so asto prevent discovery of his actions. A practical joker can use itto annoy fellow employees or students. And you can lock yourselfout if you try to log in too many times before you've hadyour morning coffee. In our experience, indefinite automatic lockoutsaren't particularly helpful. A much better method is toemploy an increasing delay mechanism in the login. After a fixednumber of unsuccessful logins, an increasing delay can be insertedbetween each successive prompt. Implementing such delays in a networkenvironment requires maintaining a record of failed login attempts,so that the delay cannot be circumvented by an attacker who merelydisconnects from the target machine and reconnects.</P><PCLASS="para"><SPANCLASS="acronym">AIX</SPAN><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2247"></A>version 4can be configured for increased delays at successive login promptsby editing the <KBDCLASS="command">logindelay</KBD> variable in the file<ICLASS="filename">/etc/security/login.cfg</I>. <SPANCLASS="acronym">AIX</SPAN>also supports automatic locking of terminals with automatic reenablementafter some time with the logindisable and loginreenable attributesin the same file.</P><PCLASS="para">The <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2253"></A>Linux operatingsystem gives the user 10 chances to log in, with an increasing delayafter each attempt. This achieves essentially the same goal as alockout (preventing someone from trying lots of passwords withina short amount of time), but it limits <ICLASS="firstterm">denial of service</I>attacks as well.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-2256"></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch03_02.htm"TITLE="3.2 Passwords"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 3.2 Passwords"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch03_04.htm"TITLE="3.4 Changing Your Password"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 3.4 Changing Your Password"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">3.2 Passwords</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">3.4 Changing Your Password</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
