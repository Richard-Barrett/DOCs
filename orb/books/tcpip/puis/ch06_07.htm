As the number of software patents issuedhas steadily grown each year, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Officehas come under increasing attack for granting too many patents whichare apparently neither new nor novel. There is also some underlyinguncertainty whether patents on software are Constitutional, butno case has yet been tried in an appropriate court to definitivelysettle the matter.</P><PCLASS="para">Some of the earliest and most important software patents grantedin the United States were in the field of public key cryptography.In particular, Stanford University was awarded two fundamental patentson the knapsack and Diffie-Hellman encryption systems, and <SPANCLASS="acronym">MIT</SPAN>was awarded a patent on the <SPANCLASS="acronym">RSA</SPAN> algorithm. <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch06_07.htm#PUIS-CHP-6-TAB-4"TITLE="The Public Key Cryptography Patents">Table 6.4</A>summarizes the various patents that have been awarded on publickey cryptography.</P><PCLASS="para">Between 1989 and 1995, all of these patents were exclusivelylicensed to Public Key Partners, a small company based in RedwoodCity, California. As this book went to press, the partnership wasdissolved, and the patents have apparently reverted to the partners,Cylink, Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif., and <SPANCLASS="acronym">RSA</SPAN> DataSecurity of Redwood City, Calif. Exactly what this change in statusmeans for people wishing to practice the inventions has not yetbeen determined.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-6-SECT-7.2">6.7.2 Cryptography and Export Controls</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-8668"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-8671"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-8674"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-8676"></A>Under current U.S. law,cryptography is a munition, akin to nuclear materials and biologicalwarfare agents. Thus, export of cryptographic machines (such ascomputer programs that implement cryptography) is covered by theDefense Trade Regulations (formerly known as the International Trafficin Arms Regulation&nbsp;- <SPANCLASS="acronym">ITAR</SPAN>). To exporta program in machine-readable format that implements cryptography,you need a license from the Office of Defense Trade Controls (<SPANCLASS="acronym">DTC</SPAN>)inside the U.S. State Department; publishing the same algorithmin a book or public paper is not controlled.</P><PCLASS="para">To get a license to export a program, you disclose the programto <SPANCLASS="acronym">DTC</SPAN>, which then makes an evaluation. (In practice,these decisions are actually made by the National Security Agency.)Historically, programs that implement sufficiently weak cryptographyare allowed to be exported; those with strong cryptography, suchas <SPANCLASS="acronym">DES</SPAN>, are denied export licenses.</P><PCLASS="para">A 1993 survey by the Software Publisher's Association,a U.S.-based industry advocacy group, found that encryption is widelyavailable in overseas computer products and that availability isgrowing. They noted the existence of more than 250 products distributedoverseas containing cryptography. Many of these products use technologiesthat are patented in the U.S. (At the time, you could literallybuy high-quality programs that implement <SPANCLASS="acronym">RSA</SPAN>encryption on the streets of Moscow, although Russia has since enactedstringent restrictions on the sale of cryptographic programs.)</P><TABLECLASS="table"><CAPTIONCLASS="table"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-6-TAB-4">Table 6.4: The Public KeyCryptography Patents</A></CAPTION><THEADCLASS="thead"><TRCLASS="row"VALIGN="TOP"><THCLASS="entry"ALIGN="LEFT"ROWSPAN="1"COLSPAN="1"><PCLASS="para">Patent #</P></TH><THCLASS="entry"ALIGN="LEFT"ROWSPAN="1"COLSPAN="1"><PCLASS="para">Title</P></TH><THCLASS="entry"ALIGN="LEFT"ROWSPAN="1"COLSPAN="1"><PCLASS="para">Covers Invention</P></TH><THCLASS="entry"ALIGN="LEFT"ROWSPAN="1"COLSPAN="1"><PCLASS="para">Inventors</P></TH><THCLASS="entry"ALIGN="LEFT"ROWSPAN="1"COLSPAN="1"><PCLASS="para">Assignee</P></TH><THCLASS="entry"ALIGN="LEFT"ROWSPAN="1"COLSPAN="1"><PCLASS="para">Date Filed</P></TH><THCLASS="entry"ALIGN="LEFT"ROWSPAN="1"COLSPAN="1"><PCLASS="para">Date Granted</P></TH><THCLASS="entry"ALIGN="LEFT"ROWSPAN="1"COLSPAN="1"><PCLASS="para">Date Expires</P></TH></TR></THEAD><TBODYCLASS="tbody"><TRCLASS="row"VALIGN="TOP"><TDCLASS="entry"ROWSPAN="1"COLSPAN="1"><PCLASS="para">4,200,770</P></TD><TDCLASS="entry"ROWSPAN="1"COLSPAN="1"><PCLASS="para">Cryptographic Apparatus and Method</P></TD><TDCLASS="entry"ROWSPAN="1"COLSPAN="1"><PCLASS="para">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</P></TD><TDCLASS="entry"ROWSPAN="1"COLSPAN="1"><PCLASS="para">Martin E.

This theory was demonstrated quitevisibly in mid-1995 when two independent groups broke 40-bit keysused in the export version of the Netscape browser.

Under currentU.S. policy, any cryptographic software can be directly exportedto Canada without the need of an export license. Canada has alsoliberalized its export policy, allowing any Canadian-made cryptographicsoftware to be further exported abroad. But software that is exportedto Canada cannot then be exported to a third country, thanks toCanada's Rule #5100, which honors U.S. exportprohibitions on &quot;all goods originating in the United States&quot;unless they have been &quot;further processed or manufacturedoutside the United States so as to result in a substantial changein value, form, or use of the goods or in the production of newgoods.&quot;</P><PCLASS="para">Several companies are now avoiding the hassle of export controlsby doing their software engineering overseas, and then importingthe products back <EMCLASS="emphasis">into</EM> the United States.
