Remember, you must be the superuser tochange another user's password.</P><PCLASS="para">For example, you can change <EMCLASS="emphasis">mary</EM>'spassword simply by typing the following:</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="screen"><PRECLASS="screen"># passwd maryNew password: dis1296Retype new password: dis1296</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Because you are the superuser, you won't be promptedfor the user's old password.</P><PCLASS="para">This approach causes the operating system to forget the user'sold password and install the new one.

Youcan tell that you are using shadow passwords if the password fieldin <EMCLASS="emphasis">/etc/passwd</EM> is blank or contains an asteriskor hash marks for every password, instead of containing regularencrypted passwords.</P><PCLASS="para">Some <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> versions require that you usea special command to edit the password file.

They may belong to someone who hasleft or is on extended leave, and therefore the account is unwatched.If the account is broken into or the files are otherwise tamperedwith, the legitimate user might not take notice for some time tocome.
