Based on those authors who are knownto authorities, they can probably be grouped into a few major categories.</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15061"></A><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Employees.</B>One of the largest categories of individuals who cause securityproblems includes disgruntled employees or ex-employees who feelthat they have been treated poorly or who bear some grudge againsttheir employer. These individuals know the potential weaknessesin an organization's computer security. Sometimes theymay install logic bombs or back doors in the software in case offuture difficulty. They may trigger the code themselves, or haveit be triggered by a bug or another employee.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15066"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15068"></A><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Thieves.</B>A second category includes thieves and embezzlers. These individualsmay attempt to disrupt the system to take advantage of the situation,or to mask evidence of their criminal activity.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15073"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15075"></A><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Spies.</B> Industrialor political espionage or sabotage is another reason people mightwrite malicious software. Programmed threats are a powerful andpotentially untraceable means of obtaining classified or proprietaryinformation, or of delaying the competition (sabotage), althoughnot very common in practice.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Extortionists.</B> <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15081"></A>Extortionmay also be a motive, with the authors threatening to unleash destructivesoftware unless paid a ransom. Many companies have been victimsof a form of extortion in which they have agreed not to prosecute(and then sometimes go on to hire) individuals who have broken intoor damaged their systems. In return, the criminals agree to disclosethe security flaws that allowed them to crack the system. An impliedthreat is that of negative publicity about the security of the companyif the perpetrator is brought to trial, and that of additional damageif the flaws are not revealed and corrected.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Experimenters.</B> Undoubtedly, some programmed threatsare written by experimenters and the curious. Other damaging softwaremay be the result of poor judgment and unanticipated bugs.[3]Of course, many accidents can be viewed as criminal, too, especiallyif they're conducted with reckless disregard for the potentialconsequences.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[3] This is particularly true of rabbit/bacteria problems.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15090"></A><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Publicity hounds.</B> Another motivation for writing a virus or worm might beto profit, gain fame, or simply derive some ego gratification fromthe pursuit. In this scenario, someone might write a virus and releaseit, and then either try to gain publicity as its discoverer, bethe first to market software that deactivates it, or simply bragabout it on a bulletin board. We do not know if this has happenedyet, but the threat is real as more media coverage of computer crimeoccurs, and as the market for antiviral and security software grows.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15095"></A><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Political activists.</B>One ongoing element in PC virus writing seems to be an underlyingpolitical motivation. These viruses make some form of politicallyoriented statement when run or detected, either as the primary purposeor as a form of smokescreen. This element raises the specter ofvirus-writing as a tool of political extremists seeking a forum,or worse, the disruption or destruction of established government,social, or business institutions. Obviously, targeting the largermachines and networks of these institutions would serve a largerpolitical goal.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">No matterwhat their numbers or motives, authors of code that intentionallydestroys other people's data are vandals. Their intentmay not be criminal, but their acts certainly are. Portraying thesepeople as heroes or simply as harmless &quot;nerds&quot;masks the dangers involved and may help protect authors who attackwith more malicious intent. <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15099"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15101"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15104"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15107"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch11_02.htm"TITLE="11.2 Damage"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 11.2 Damage"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch11_04.htm"TITLE="11.4 Entry"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 11.4 Entry"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">11.2 Damage</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">11.4 Entry</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
