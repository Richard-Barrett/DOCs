Most backdoors, logic bombs, Trojan horses, and bacteria appear on your systembecause they were written there. Perhaps the biggest security threatto a computer system is its own user group. Users understand thesystem, know its weaknesses, and know the auditing and control systemsthat are in place. Legitimate users often have access with sufficientprivilege to write and introduce malicious code into the system.Especially ironic, perhaps, is the idea that at many companies theperson responsible for security and control is also the person whocould cause the most damage if he wished to issue the appropriatecommands.</P><PCLASS="para">Users also may be unwitting agents of transmissionfor viruses, worms, and other such threats. They may install newsoftware from outside, and install embedded malicious code at thesame time. Software obtained from public domain sources traditionallyhas been a source of system infection. Not all public domain softwareis contaminated, of course; most of it is not. Commercial productsalso have been known to be infected. The real difficulties occurwhen employees do not understand the potential problems that mayresult from the introduction of software that has not been checkedthoroughly, no matter what its source. Such software includes the&quot;click-and-download&quot; paradigm of <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN>browsers.</P><PCLASS="para">A third possible method of entry occurs ifa machine is connected to a <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15123"></A>network or some other means of computer-to-computercommunication. Programs may be written on the outside and find theirway into a machine through these connections. This is the way wormsusually enter systems. Worms may carry logic bombs or viruses withthem, thus introducing those problems into the computer at the sametime.</P><PCLASS="para">Programmed threats can easily enter most machines.Environments with poor controls abound, caused in part by the generallack of security training and expertise within the computing community.Few college-level programs in computer science and computer engineeringeven offer an elective in computer security (or computer ethics),so few computer users&nbsp;- even those with extensive training&nbsp;- havethe background to help safeguard their systems.</P><PCLASS="para">Nomatter how the systems initially became infected, the situationis usually made worse when the software spreads throughout all susceptiblesystems within the same office or plant. Most systems are configuredto trust the users, machines, and services in the local environment.Thus, there are even fewer restrictions and restraints in placeto prevent the spread of malicious software within a local clusteror network of computers. Because the users of such an environmentoften share resources (including programs, diskettes, and even workstations),the spread of malicious software within such an environment is hastenedconsiderably. Eradicating malicious software from such an environmentis also more difficult because identifying all sources of the problemis almost impossible, as is purging all those locations at the sametime.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch11_03.htm"TITLE="11.3 Authors"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 11.3 Authors"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch11_05.htm"TITLE="11.5 Protecting Yourself"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 11.5 Protecting Yourself"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">11.3 Authors</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">11.5 Protecting Yourself</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
