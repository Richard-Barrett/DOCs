It's the alarm system that callsthe police department when a late-night thief tries to break intoyour building. It's the key lock on the computer'spower supply that makes it harder for unauthorized people to turnthe machine off. And it's the surge protector that keepsa computer from being damaged by power surges.</P><PCLASS="para">Thischapter discusses basic physical security approaches. It'sdesigned for people who think that this form of security is of noconcern. Unfortunately, physical security is an oft-overlooked aspectof security that is <EMCLASS="emphasis">very</EM> important. You mayhave the best encryption and security tools in place, and your <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>systems may be safely hidden behind a firewall. However, if youcheerfully hire an industrial spy as your system administrator,and she walks off with your disk drives, those other fancy defensesaren't much help.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-12-SECT-1">12.1 One Forgotten Threat</A></H2><PCLASS="para">Surprisingly, manyorganizations do not consider physical security to be of the utmostconcern. One New York investment house was spending tens of thousandsof dollars on computer security measures to prevent break-ins duringthe day, only to discover that its cleaning staff was propping openthe doors to the computer room at night while the floor was beingmopped. In the late 1980s, a magazine in San Francisco had morethan $100,000 worth of computers stolen over a holiday:an employee had used his electronic key card to unlock the buildingand disarm the alarm system; after getting inside, the person wentto the supply closet where the alarm system was located and removedpaper from the alarm system's log printer.</P><PCLASS="para">Physicalsecurity is one of the most frequently forgotten forms of securitybecause the issues that physical security encompasses&nbsp;- thethreats, practices, and protections available&nbsp;- are differentfor practically every different site. Physical security resistssimple treatment in books on computer security, as different organizationsrunning the identical system software might have dramatically differentphysical-security needs. (Many popular books on <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>system security do not even mention physical security.) Becausephysical security must inherently be installed on-site, it cannotbe pre-installed by the operating system vendor, sold by telemarketers,or <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN>'ed over the Internet as partof a free set of security tools.</P><PCLASS="para">Anything that we canwrite about physical security must therefore be broadly stated andgeneral. Because every site is different, this chapter can'tgive you a set of specific recommendations. It can only give youa starting point, a list of issues to consider, and a procedurefor formulating your plan.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-12-SECT-1.1">12.1.1 The Physical Security Plan</A></H3><PCLASS="para">The firststep to physically securing your installation is to formulate awritten plan addressing your current physical security needs andyour intended future direction&nbsp;- something we discussed in<ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch02_01.htm"TITLE="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2, <CITECLASS="chapter">Policies and Guidelines</CITE></A>.
