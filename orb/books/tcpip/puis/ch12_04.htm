The site, located in an office park with several largebuildings, included computers for product design and testing, nationwidemanagement of inventory, sales, and customer support. It includeda sophisticated, automated voice-response system costing thousandsof dollars a month to operate; hundreds of users; and dozens ofT1 (1.44 Mbits/sec) communications lines for the corporatenetwork, carrying both voice and data communications.</P><PCLASS="para">Thecompany thought that it had reasonable security&nbsp;- given thefact that it didn't have anything to lose.

Althoughsmoke detectors and sprinklers were located below the false ceiling,none were located above, where the cables were located.

The attacker might be a corporate spyfor a competing firm, or might simply be a disgruntled employee.Given the ease of stealing computer equipment, the company alsohad reason to fear less-than-honest employees.
