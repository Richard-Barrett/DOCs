Ratherthan admit to the losses, each of them altered computer recordsand effectively gambled more money to recoup the losses. Eventually,both were discovered after each bank lost more than one billiondollars. As a result, Barings was forced into insolvency, and Daiwamay not be allowed to operate in the United States in the future.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">In the U.S., personnel with the <SPANCLASS="acronym">CIA</SPAN>and armed forces with high-security clearances (Aldrich Ames, JonathonPollard, and Robert Walker) were discovered to have been passingclassified information to Russia and to Israel. Despite severalspecial controls for security, these individuals were able to commitdamaging acts of espionage.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">Ifyou examine these cases and the vast number of computer securityviolations committed over the past few decades, you will find onecommon characteristic: 100% of them were caused by people.Break-ins were caused by people. Computer viruses were written bypeople. Passwords were stolen by people. Without people, we wouldn'thave computer security problems! However, we continue to have peopleinvolved with computers, so we need to be concerned with personnelsecurity.</P><PCLASS="para">&quot;Personnel security&quot; iseverything involving employees: hiring them, training them, monitoringtheir behavior, and sometimes, handling their departure. Statisticsshow that the most common perpetrators of significant computer crimeare those people who have legitimate access now, or who have recentlyhad access; some studies show that over 80% of incidentsare caused by these individuals. Thus, managing personnel with privilegedaccess is an important part of a good security plan.</P><PCLASS="para">Peopleare involved in computer security problems in two ways. Some peopleunwittingly aid in the commission of security incidents by failingto follow proper procedure, by forgetting security considerations,and by not understanding what they are doing. Other people knowinglyviolate controls and procedures to cause or aid an incident. Aswe have noted earlier, the people who knowingly contribute to yoursecurity problems are most often your own users (or recent users):they are the ones who know the controls, and know what informationof value may be present.</P><PCLASS="para">You are likely to encounterboth kinds of individuals in the course of administering a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>system. The controls and mechanisms involved in personnel securityare many and varied. Discussions of all of them could fill an entirebook, so we'll simply summarize some of the major considerations.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-13-SECT-1">13.1 Background Checks</A></H2><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17059"></A>When you hire new employees, check theirbackgrounds. You may have candidates fill out application forms,but then what do you do? At the least, you should check all referencesgiven by each applicant to determine his past record, includingreasons why he left those positions. Be certain to verify the datesof employment, and check any gaps in the record. One story we heardinvolved an applicant who had an eight-year gap in his record entitled&quot;independent consulting.&quot; Further research revealedthat this &quot;consulting&quot; was being conducted frominside a Federal prison cell&nbsp;- something the applicant hadfailed to disclose, no doubt because it was the result of a convictionfor computer-based fraud.</P><PCLASS="para">You should also verify anyclaims of educational achievement and certification: stories aboundof individuals who have claimed to have earned graduate degreesfrom prestigious universities&nbsp;- universities that have norecords of those individuals ever completing a class. Other casesinvolve degrees from &quot;universities&quot; that are littlemore than a post office box.</P><PCLASS="para">Consider that an applicantwho lies to get a job with you is not establishing a good foundationfor future trust.</P><PCLASS="para">In some instances you may want tomake more intensive investigations of the character and backgroundof the candidates. You may want to:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Have an investigation agency do abackground check.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Get a criminal record check of the individual.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Check the applicant's credit record forevidence of large personal debt and the inability to pay it. Discussproblems, if you find them, with the applicant. People who are indebt should not be denied jobs: if they are, they will never beable to regain solvency. At the same time, employees who are underfinancial strain may be more likely to act improperly.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Conduct a <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17073"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17075"></A>polygraph examination of the applicant (if legal).</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Ask the applicant to obtain bonding for his position.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">In general, we don't recommend these steps for hiringevery employee. However, you should conduct extra checks of anyemployee who will be in a position of trust or privileged access&nbsp;- includingmaintenance and cleaning personnel.</P><PCLASS="para">We also suggestthat you inform the applicant that you are performing these checks,and obtain his or her consent. This courtesy will make the checkseasier to perform and will put the applicant on notice that youare serious about your precautions.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch12_04.htm"TITLE="12.4 Story: A Failed Site Inspection"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 12.4 Story: A Failed Site Inspection"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch13_02.htm"TITLE="13.2 On the Job"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 13.2 On the Job"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">12.4 Story: A Failed Site Inspection</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">13.2 On the Job</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
