At the least, this educationshould include procedures for password selection and use, physicalaccess to computers, backup procedures, dial-in policies, and thepolicies for divulging information over the telephone. Executivesshould not be excluded from these classes because of their status&nbsp;- theyare as likely (or more likely) as other personnel to pick poor passwordsand commit other errors. They, too, must demonstrate their commitmentto security: security consciousness flows from the top down, notthe other way.</P><PCLASS="para">Education should include written materialsand a copy of the computer-use policy. The education should includediscussion of appropriate and inappropriate use of the computersand networks, personal use of computing equipment (during and afterhours), policy on ownership and use of electronic mail, and policieson the import and export of software and papers. Penalties for violationsof these policies should also be detailed.</P><PCLASS="para">All usersshould sign a form acknowledging the receipt of this information,and their acceptance of its restrictions. These forms should beretained. Later, if any question arises as to whether the employeewas given prior warning about what was allowed, there will be proof.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-13-SECT-2.2">13.2.2 Ongoing Training and Awareness</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17099"></A>Periodically, users should be presentedwith refresher information about security and appropriate use ofthe computers. This retraining is an opportunity to explain goodpractice, remind users of current threats and their consequences,and provide a forum to air questions and concerns.</P><PCLASS="para">Yourstaff should also be given adequate opportunities for ongoing training.This training should include support to attend professional conferencesand seminars, to subscribe to professional and trade periodicals,and to obtain reference books and other training materials. Yourstaff must also be given sufficient time to make use of the material,and positive incentives to master it.</P><PCLASS="para">Coupled with periodiceducation, you may wish to employ various methods of continuingawareness. These methods could include putting up posters or noticesabout good practice,[1] having periodic messages ofthe day with tips and reminders, having an &quot;Awareness Day&quot;every few months, or having other events to keep security from fadinginto the background.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] If you do this, change themperiodically. A poster or notice that has not changed in many monthsbecomes invisible.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Of course, the nature of your organization,the level of threat and possible loss, and the size and nature ofyour user population should all be factored into your plans. Thecost of awareness activities should also be considered and budgetedin advance.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-13-SECT-2.3">13.2.3 Performance Reviews and Monitoring</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17110"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17113"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17116"></A>The performance of your staff shouldbe reviewed periodically. In particular, the staff should be givencredit and rewarded for professional growth and good practice. Atthe same time, problems should be identified and addressed in aconstructive manner. You must encourage staff members to increasetheir abilities and enhance their understanding.</P><PCLASS="para">Youalso want to avoid creating situations in which staff members feeloverworked, underappreciated, or ignored. Creating such a workingenvironment can lead to carelessness and a lack of interest in protectingthe interests of the organization. The staff could also leave forbetter opportunities. Or worse, the staff could become involvedin acts of disruption as a matter of revenge. <ACLASS="email"HREF="mailto:overtimeOvertime mustbe an exception and not the rule, and all employees-especially thosein critical positions-must be given adequate holiday and vacationtime."><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17122"></A>Overtime mustbe an exception and not the rule, and all employees-especially thosein critical positions-must be given adequate holiday and vacationtime.</A></P><PCLASS="para">In general, users with privilegesshould be monitored for signs of excessive stress, personal problems,or other indications of difficulties. Identifying such problemsand providing help, where possible, is at the very least humane.Such practice is also a way to preserve valuable resources&nbsp;- theusers themselves, and the resources to which they have access. Auser under considerable financial or personal stress might spontaneouslytake some action that he would never consider under more normalsituations...and that action might be damaging to your operations.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-13-SECT-2.4">13.2.4 Auditing Access</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17128"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17131"></A>Ensurethat auditing of access to equipment and data is enabled, and ismonitored. Furthermore, ensure that anyone with such access knowsthat auditing is enabled. Many instances of computer abuse are spontaneousin nature. If a possible malefactor knows that the activity andaccess are logged, he might be discouraged in his actions.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-13-SECT-2.5">13.2.5 Least Privilege and Separation of Duties</A></H3><PCLASS="para">Considercarefully the time-tested principles of least privilege and separationof duties. These should be employed wherever practical in your operations.</P><DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term">Least privilege</DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17142"></A>This principlestates that you give each person the minimum access necessary todo his or her job. This restricted access is both logical (accessto accounts, networks, programs) and physical (access to computers,backup tapes, and other peripherals). If every user has accountson every system and has physical access to everything, then allusers are roughly equivalent in level of threat.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term">Separation of duties </DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17148"></A>Thisprinciple states that you should carefully separate duties so thatpeople involved in checking for inappropriate use are not also capableof making such inappropriate use. Thus, having all the securityfunctions and audit responsibilities reside in the same person isdangerous. This practice can lead to a case in which the personmay violate security policy and commit prohibited acts, yet in whichno other person sees the audit trail to be alerted to the problem.</P></DD></DL><DIVCLASS="sidebar"><H4CLASS="sidebar"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-17150">Beware Key Employees</A></H4><PCLASS="para">Noone in an organization should be irreplaceable, because no humanis immortal. If your organization depends on the ongoing performanceof a key employee, then your organization is at risk.</P><PCLASS="para">Organizationscannot help but have key employees. To be secure, organizationsshould have written policies and plans established for unexpectedillness or departure.</P><PCLASS="para">In one case that we are familiarwith, a small company with 100 employees had spent more than 10years developing its own custom-written accounting and order entrysystem. The system was written in a programming language that wasnot readily known, originally provided by a company that had possiblygone out of business. Two people understood the organization'ssystem: the <SPANCLASS="acronym">MIS</SPAN> director and her programmer.These two people were responsible for making changes to the accountsystem's programs, preparing annual reports, repairingcomputer equipment when it broke, and even performing backups (whichwere stored, off-site, at the <SPANCLASS="acronym">MIS</SPAN> director'shome office).</P><PCLASS="para">What would happen if the <SPANCLASS="acronym">MIS</SPAN>director and her programmer were killed one day in a car accidenton their way to meet with a vendor? What would happen if the <SPANCLASS="acronym">MIS</SPAN>director were offered a better job, at twice the salary?</P><PCLASS="para">Thatkey personnel are irreplaceable is one of the real costs associatedwith computer systems &nbsp;- one that is rarely appreciated byan organization's senior management. The drawbacks of thiscase illustrate one more compelling reason to use off-the-shelfsoftware, and to have established written policies and procedures,so that a newly hired replacement can easily fill another'sshoes.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-13-SECT-2.6">13.2.6 Departure</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17164"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17166"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17168"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17170"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17172"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17175"></A>Personnel leave,sometimes on their own, and sometimes involuntarily. In either case,you should have a defined set of actions for how to handle the departure.This procedure should include shutting down accounts; forwardingemail; changing critical passwords, phone numbers, and combinations;and otherwise removing access to your systems.</P><PCLASS="para">In someenvironments, this suggestion may be too drastic. In the case ofa university, for instance, graduated students might be allowedto keep accounts active for months or years after they leave. Insuch cases, you must determine exactly what access is to be allowedand what access is to be disallowed. Make certain that the personnelinvolved know exactly what the limits are.</P><PCLASS="para">In otherenvironments, a departure is quite sudden and dramatic. Someonemay show up at work, only to find the locks changed and a securityguard waiting with a box containing everything that was in the user'sdesk drawers. The account has already been deleted; all system passwordshave been changed; and the user's office phone number isno longer assigned. This form of separation management is quitecommon in financial service industries, and is understood to bepart of the job.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17180"></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch13_01.htm"TITLE="13.1 Background Checks"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 13.1 Background Checks"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch13_03.htm"TITLE="13.3 Outsiders"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 13.3 Outsiders"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">13.1 Background Checks</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">13.3 Outsiders</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
