After all,a computer by itself is really nothing more than an overgrown programmablecalculator&nbsp;- a word processor with delusions of grandeur.But with a modem or a network interface, computers can &quot;speak&quot;and send information.</P><PCLASS="para">A good communications infrastructureworks both ways: not only does it let you get information <EMCLASS="emphasis">out</EM>,it also lets you get back <EMCLASS="emphasis">in </EM>to your computerwhen you're at home or out of town. If your computer isequipped with a modem that answers incoming telephone calls, youcan dial up when you're sick or on vacation and read yourelectronic mail, keep informed with your online news services, oreven work on a financial projection if the whim suddenly strikesyou. You can almost believe that you never left the office in thefirst place!</P><PCLASS="para">But in the world of computer security,good communications can be a double-edged sword. Communicationsequipment can aid attackers and saboteurs while it enables you toget information in and out easily. As with most areas of computersecurity, the way to protect yourself is not to shun the technology,but to embrace it carefully, making sure that it can'tbe turned against you.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-14-SECT-1">14.1 Modems: Theory of Operation</A></H2><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Modems</EM>are devices that let computers transmit information over ordinarytelephone lines. The word explains how the device works: modem isan acronym for &quot;modulator/demodulator.&quot;Modems translate a stream of information into a series of tones(modulating) at one end of the telephone line, and translate thetones back into the serial stream at the other end of the connection(demodulating). Most modems are <EMCLASS="emphasis"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17245"></A>bidirectional</EM>&nbsp;- everymodem contains both a modulator and a demodulator, so a data transfercan take place in both directions simultaneously.</P><PCLASS="para">Modemshave a flexibility that is unparalleled by other communicationstechnologies. Because modems work with standard telephone lines,and use the public telephone network to route their conversations,any computer that is equipped with a modem and a telephone linecan communicate with any other computer that has a modem and a telephoneline, anywhere in the world. Thus, even in this age of the Internetand local area networks, modems are still the single most commonway that people access computers remotely. This trend is likelyto continue into at least the near future, especially with the continuingpopularity of specialized dial bulletin board systems (<SPANCLASS="acronym">BBSS</SPAN>).</P><PCLASS="para">Early computer modems commonly operated at 110 or 300 baud,transmitting information at a rate of 10 or 30 characters per second,respectively. Today, in 1996, few computer modems are sold thatare not capable of 14,400 bits per second (bps), and modems thatzip along at 28,800 bps are increasingly popular. Some modems thatsend data synchronously, with a precision clock, are capable ofrates in excess of 100,000 bps. Special modems on digital <SPANCLASS="acronym">ISDN</SPAN>lines are also capable of speeds in excess of 100,000 bps. Withdata compression included, and new technology constantly being offered,we expect to see common modems with increasingly higher speeds (andsmaller physical sizes) as time goes on.</P><DIVCLASS="sidebar"><H4CLASS="sidebar"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-17251">Baud and bps</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17255"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17257"></A>Baud</EM>is named after the 19th-century French inventor, J. M. E. Baudot.He invented a method of encoding letters and digits into bit patternsfor transmission. A 5-bit descendent of his code is still used intoday's <SPANCLASS="acronym">TELEX</SPAN> systems.</P><PCLASS="para">5to 12 bits are required to transmit a &quot;standard&quot;character, depending on whether we make upper/lower caseavailable, transmit <EMCLASS="emphasis">check-bits</EM>, and so on.A multi-byte character code may require many times that for eachcharacter. The standard <SPANCLASS="acronym">ISO</SPAN> 8859-1 characterset requires eight bits per character, and simple <SPANCLASS="acronym">ASCII</SPAN>requires seven bits. Computer data transmitted over a serial lineusually consists of one <ICLASS="firstterm">start bit</I>, sevenor eight <EMCLASS="emphasis">data bits</EM>, one <EMCLASS="emphasis">parity </EM>or<EMCLASS="emphasis">space bit</EM>, and one <ICLASS="firstterm">stop bit</I>.The number of characters per second is thus usually equal to thenumber of bits per second divided by 10.</P><PCLASS="para">The word &quot;baud[1]&quot;refers to the number of audible tokens per second that are sentover the telephone line. On 110- and 300-bits-per-second (bps) modems,the baud rate equals the bps rate. On 1200-, 2400-, and higher-bpsmodems, a variety of audible encoding techniques are used to crammore information into each audible token. <SPANCLASS="acronym">TDD</SPAN>phone devices for the deaf use a lower-speed modem than modern computersusually do.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17273"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17275"></A></P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] The &quot;baud&quot; is not to be confused with the&quot;bawd,&quot; which is the rate at which juveniles transmitrisqu&eacute; pictures over network connections.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="PART"HREF="part04.htm"TITLE="IV.
