Modemscan be used by individuals inside your organization to remove confidentialinformation. Modems can be used by people outside your organizationto gain unauthorized access to your computer. If your modems canbe reprogrammed or otherwise subverted, they can be used to trickyour users into revealing their passwords. And, finally, an attackercan eavesdrop on a modem communication.</P><PCLASS="para">Today, modemsremain a popular tool for breaking into large corporate networks.The reason is simple: while corporations closely monitor their networkconnections, modems are largely unguarded. In many organizations,there is no good way to prevent users from putting modems on theirdesktop computers and running &quot;remote access&quot;software.</P><PCLASS="para">So what can be done? To maximize security,modems should be provided by the organization and administered ina secure fashion.</P><PCLASS="para">The first step is to protect the modemsthemselves. Be sure they are located in a physically secure location,so that no unauthorized individual can access them. This protectionis to prevent the modems from being altered or rewired. Some modemscan have altered microcode or passwords loaded into them by someonewith appropriate access, and you want to prevent such occurrences.You might make a note of the configuration switches (if any) onthe modem, and periodically check them to be certain they remainunchanged.</P><PCLASS="para">Many modems sold these days allow remoteconfiguration and testing. This capability makes changes simplerfor personnel who manage several remote locations. It also makesabusing your modems simpler for an attacker. Therefore, be certainthat such features, if present in your modems, are disabled.</P><PCLASS="para">The next most important aspect of protecting your modems isto protect their telephone numbers. Treat the telephone numbersfor your modems the same as you treat your passwords: don'tpublicize them to anyone other than those who have a need to know.Making the telephone numbers for your modems widely known increasesthe chances that somebody might try to use them to break into yoursystem. We'll describe some approaches in later sections.</P><PCLASS="para">Unfortunately, you cannot keep the telephone numbers of yourmodems absolutely secret. After all, people do need to call them.And even if you were extremely careful with the numbers, an attackercould always discover the modem numbers by dialing every telephonenumber in your exchange. For this reason, simple secrecy isn'ta solution; your modems need more stringent protection.[2]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[2] Youmight think about changing your modem phone numbers on a yearlybasis as a basic precaution.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-14-SECT-4.1">14.4.1 One-Way Phone Lines</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17600"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17604"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17606"></A>Most sites set up theirmodems and telephone lines so that they can both initiate and receivecalls. Under older versions of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>, you couldnot use a modem for both purposes. Many vendors developed theirown mechanisms to allow modems to be used bidirectionally.</P><PCLASS="para">Havingmodems be able to initiate and receive calls may seem like an economicalway to make the most use of your modems and phone lines.

(You also run the riskthat all of your outbound lines may prevent people from dialinginto your system.) By forcing telephones to be used for either inboundor outbound calls, you assure that one use of the system will notpreclude the other.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If your modems are used for both inbound and outboundcalls, an attacker can use this capability to subvert any callbacksystems (see the sidebar) that you may be employing.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">Your system will therefore be more secure if you use separatemodems for inbound and outbound traffic.</P><PCLASS="para">You may furtherwish to routinely monitor the configuration of your telephone linesto check for the following conditions:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Check to make sure that telephonelines used only for inbound calls cannot place outbound calls.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Check to make sure that telephone lines that arenot used to call long-distance telephone numbers in fact cannotplace long-distance telephone calls.</P></LI></UL></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-14-SECT-4.2">14.4.2 </A></H3><DIVCLASS="sidebar"><H4CLASS="sidebar"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-17633">Subverting Callback</A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17636"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17638"></A>A callback scheme is one in which an outsidercalls your machine, connects to the software, and provides someform of identification. The system then severs the connection andcalls the outsider back at a predetermined phone number. This schemeenhances security because the system will dial only preauthorizednumbers, so an attacker cannot get the system to initiate a connectionto his or her modem.</P><PCLASS="para">Unfortunately, callback can besubverted if the same modem that the outsider called is used tocall the user back. Many phone systems, and especially some <SPANCLASS="acronym">PBX</SPAN>systems, will not disconnect a call initiated from an outside lineuntil the outside line is hung up.</P><PCLASS="para">To subvert sucha callback system, the attacker merely calls the &quot;callbackmodem&quot; and then does not hang up when the modem attemptsto sever the connection. The modem tries to hang up, then picksthe phone back up and tries to dial out. The attacker'smodem is then set to answer the callback modem, and the system issubverted. This type of attack can also be performed on systemsthat are not using a callback, but are doing normal dialout operations.For example, the attack can be used to intercept messages that aresent over a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UUCP</SPAN> connection; the attacker merelyconfigures a computer system to have the same name and <SPANCLASS="acronym">UUCP</SPAN>login account as the system that is being called.</P><PCLASS="para">Somecallback systems attempt to get around this problem by waiting fora dial tone. Unfortunately, these modems can be fooled by an attackerwho simply plays a recording of a dial tone over the open line.</P><PCLASS="para">The only way to foil an attacker who is attemptingthis kind of trick is to have two sets of modems&nbsp;- one setfor dialing in, and one set for dialing out. To make this work,you should have the telephone company install the lines so thatthe incoming lines cannot be used to dial out, and the outgoinglines have no telephone number for dialing in. This setup costsmore than a regular line, but adds an extra measure of securityfor your phone connections.</P><PCLASS="para">Note that even with theseprecautions, there are other ways to subvert a calback. For example,someone could install call-forwarding on the called-back numberand reroute the call through the switches at the phone company.Callback schemes can enhance your system's overall security,but you should not depend on them as your only means of protection.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-14-SECT-4.3">14.4.3 Caller-ID (CNID)</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17652"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17654"></A>In many areas, you can purchasean additional telephone service called Caller-ID. As its name implies,Caller-ID identifies the phone number of each incoming telephonecall. The phone number is usually displayed on a small box nextto the telephone when the phone starts ringing. (Note that thisfeature may not be available to you if you own your own <SPANCLASS="acronym">PBX</SPAN>or switch.)</P><PCLASS="para">The telephone company sells Caller-ID onthe virtues of its privacy and security: by knowing the phone numberof an incoming call, you can make the decision as to whether ornot you wish to answer it.</P><PCLASS="para">Caller-ID can also be usedwith computers. Several modem makers now support Caller-ID directly.With one of these modems, you can program the modem to send thetelephone number of the calling instrument to the computer. Youcan then write custom software to limit incoming calls to a specifiedlist of phone numbers, or to only allow certain users to use certainphones.</P><PCLASS="para">The telephone company's IntegratedServices Digital Network (<SPANCLASS="acronym">ISDN</SPAN>[3]) digital phoneservice also provides the phone number of the caller through a similarservice called Automatic Number Identification (<SPANCLASS="acronym">ANI</SPAN>).This service is available to many corporate 800-number subscribers.<SPANCLASS="acronym">ISDN</SPAN> offers yet another service called RestrictedCalling Groups, which allows you to specify a list of phone numbersthat are allowed to call your telephone number. All other callersare blocked.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[3] Inmany areas of the country, ISDN still stands for &quot;InterestingServices Doing Nothing.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Advanced telephone services such as theseare only as secure as the underlying telephone network infrastructure:if an attacker managed to break into the telephone company'scomputers, that attacker could reprogram them to display incorrectnumbers on the Caller-ID display, or to bypass Restricted CallingGroups. Although there are no officially acknowledged cases of suchattacks, the possibility exists, and many credible but &quot;informal&quot;accounts of such incidents have been recounted. <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17666"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17668"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-14-SECT-4.4">14.4.4 Protecting Against Eavesdropping</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17673"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17675"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-17678"></A>Modemsthat are not <EMCLASS="emphasis">adaptive </EM>are very susceptibleto eavesdropping and wiretapping.
