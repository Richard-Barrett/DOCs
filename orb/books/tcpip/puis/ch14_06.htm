In the future, the telephone system might be able to easilyprevent people from calling your computer's modem unlessyou have specifically preauthorized them. Until then, we will haveto rely on other mechanisms to protect our modems and computersfrom intruders.</P><PCLASS="para">Although usernames and passwords providea degree of security, they are not foolproof. Users often pick badpasswords, and even good passwords can occasionally be guessed ordiscovered by other means.</P><PCLASS="para">For this reason, a varietyof special kinds of modems have been developed that further protectcomputers from unauthorized access. These modems are more expensivethan traditional modems, but they do provide an added degree ofsecurity and trust.</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Password modems. </B><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18149"></A>These modems require the caller to enter a passwordbefore the modem connects the caller to the computer. As with regular<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> passwords, the security provided by thesemodems can be defeated by repeated password guessing or by havingan authorized person release his password to somebody who is notauthorized. Usually, these modems can only store one to ten passwords.The password stored in the modem should <EMCLASS="emphasis">not</EM>be the same as the password of any user. Some versions of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>can be set up to require special passwords for access by modem.Password modems are probably unnecessary on systems of this kind;the addition of yet another password may be more than your usersare prepared to tolerate.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Callback setups</B>.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18157"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18159"></A>As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, theseschemes require the caller to enter a username, and then immediatelyhang up the telephone line. The modem then will call the callerback on a predetermined telephone number. These schemes offer ahigher degree of security than regular modems, although they canbe defeated by somebody who calls the callback modem at the precisemoment that it is trying to make its outgoing telephone call. Mostcallback modems can only store a few numbers to call back. Thesemodems can also be defeated on some kinds of <SPANCLASS="acronym">PBX</SPAN>systems by not hanging up the telephone line when the computer attemptsto dial back.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Encrypting modems</B>.These modems, which <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18166"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18169"></A>must be used in pairs, encryptall information transmitted and received over the telephone lines.These modems offer an extremely high degree of security not onlyagainst individuals attempting to gain unauthorized access, butalso against wiretapping. Some encrypting modems contain preassignedcryptographic &quot;keys&quot; that work only in pairs.Other modems contain keys that can be changed on a routine basis,to further enhance security. (<ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch06_01.htm"TITLE="Cryptography">Chapter 6, <CITECLASS="chapter">Cryptography</CITE></A>,contains a complete discussion of encryption.)</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Caller-ID and <SPANCLASS="acronym">ANI</SPAN> schemes.</B> These<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18177"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18179"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18181"></A>usea relatively new feature available on many digital telephone switches.As described in the section &quot;&quot; earlier in thischapter, you can use the information provided by the telephone companyfor logging or controlling access. Already, some commercial firmsprovide a form of call screening using <SPANCLASS="acronym">ANI</SPAN> (AutomaticNumber Identification) for their 800 numbers (which have had <SPANCLASS="acronym">ANI</SPAN>available since the late 1980s). When the user calls the 800 number,the <SPANCLASS="acronym">ANI</SPAN> information is checked against a listof authorized phone numbers, and the call is switched to the company'scomputer only if the number is approved.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18186"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18189"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18192"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18194"></A></P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para"></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch14_05.htm"TITLE="14.5 Modems and UNIX"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 14.5 Modems and UNIX"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="CHAPTER"HREF="ch15_01.htm"TITLE="15.
