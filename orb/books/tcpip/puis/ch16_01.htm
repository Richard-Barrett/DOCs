Networkshave become such an indispensable part of so many people'slives that one can hardly imagine using modern computers withoutthem.</P><PCLASS="para">But networks have also brought with them theirshare of security problems, precisely because of their power tolet users easily share information and resources. Networks allowpeople you have never met to reach out and touch you&nbsp;- anderase all of your files in the process. They have enabled individualsto launch sophisticated electronic attacks against major institutionsas well as desktop computers in home offices. Indeed, networks havecreated almost as many risks as they have created opportunities.</P><PCLASS="para">The next six chapters of this book discuss <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>security issues arising from the deployment of computer networks.In this chapter we describe local and wide area networks, and showhow they fit into the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> security picture.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-16-SECT-1">16.1 Networking</A></H2><PCLASS="para">From a practical viewpoint,computer users today usually divide the world of networking intotwo halves:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-19848"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-19851"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-19853"></A>LocalArea Networks (<SPANCLASS="acronym">LANS</SPAN>) are high-speed networksused to connect together computers at a single location.

The Internet is an IP-based[2] network that encompasses hundredsof thousands of computers and tens of millions of users throughoutthe world.

Security problems were rare: if somebody on the networkwas disruptive, tracking him down and having him disciplined wasa simple matter. In extreme cases, people could lose their networkprivileges, or even their jobs (which produced the same result).In many ways, the Internet was a large, private club.</P><PCLASS="para">Thesedays the Internet is not so exclusive. The Internet has grown solarge that you can almost never determine the identity of somebodywho is breaking into your system: attackers may appear to be comingfrom a university in upstate New York, but the real story can bequite different. Attackers based in the Netherlands could have brokeninto a system in Australia, connected through the Australian systemto a system in South Africa, and finally connected through the SouthAfrican system to a New York university. The attackers could thenuse the New York account as a base of operations to launch attacksagainst other sites, with little chance of being traced back totheir own site.

In each of these cases,there may be considerable resources arrayed against any attemptto identify and prosecute the perpetrators.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[3] Some authorities speculate (in private)that as many as a third of break-ins to major corporate and governmentcomputers in the U.S. may be the result of &quot;probe&quot;attempts by foreign agents, at least indirectly.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-16-SECT-1.2">16.1.2 Networking and UNIX</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-19965"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-19968"></A>has both benefitedfrom and contributed to the popularity of networking.
