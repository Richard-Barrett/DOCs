On April Fools day comes a series of forged, tongue-in-cheekmessages, either from non-existent sites or using the name of a WellKnown USENET person. In general, these messages are harmless and meantas a joke,and people who respond to these messages without thinking,either by flaming or otherwise responding, generally end up lookingrather silly when the forgery is exposed. So, for the next couple of weeks, if you see a message that seemscompletely out of line or is otherwise unusual, think twice beforeposting a followup or responding to it; it's very likely a forgery.There are a few ways of checking to see if a message is a forgery.These aren't foolproof, but since most forgery posters want people tofigure it out, they will allow you to track down the vast majority offorgeries:* Russian computers. For historic reasons most forged messageshave as part of their Path: a non-existent (we think!) russiancomputer, either kremvax or moscvax. Other possibilities are nsacyberor wobegon. Please note, however, that walldrug is a real site andisn't a forgery.* Posted dates. Almost invariably, the date of the posting is forgedto be April 1. * Funky Message-ID. Subtle hints are often lodged into theMessage-Id, as that field is more or less an unparsed text string andcan contain random information. Common values include pi, the phonenumber of the red phone in the white house, and the name of theforger's parrot.* Subtle mispellings. Look for subtle misspellings of the host namesin the Path: field when a message is forged in the name of a Big NameUSENET person. This is done so that the person being forged actuallygets a chance to see the message and wonder when he actually posted it.Forged messages, of course, are not to be condoned. But they happen,and it's important for people on the net not to over-react. They happen at this time every year, and the forgergenerally gets their kick from watching the novice users take theposting seriously and try to flame their tails off. If we can keep alevel head and not react to these postings, they'll taper off ratherquickly and we can return to the normal state of affairs: chaos.Thanks for your support.Gene Spafford, Spokeman, The Backbone Cabal.</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">The April 1 post is funny,because it contains all of the signs of a forged message that itclaims to warn the reader about.
