DECnet provides many of the same basic functionsas IP, including mail, virtual terminals, file sharing, and networktime. During its heyday, many third parties also built peripheralsto support DECnet. Many large DECnet networks have been built, butthe trend within Digital has been to migrate to open standards suchas IP.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-16-SECT-4.4">16.4.4 OSI</A></H3><PCLASS="para">The <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21395"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-21397"></A>Open System Interconnection(<SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN>) protocols, developed by the InternationalStandards Organization (<SPANCLASS="acronym">ISO</SPAN>), are an incrediblycomplex and complete set of protocols for every kind of networkimplementation. <SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN> was developed after <SPANCLASS="acronym">TCP/IP</SPAN>,and supports many of the same kinds of services.</P><PCLASS="para"><SPANCLASS="acronym">OSI</SPAN>is a classic example of what happens when a committee is asked todevelop a complex specification without the benefit of first developingworking code.
