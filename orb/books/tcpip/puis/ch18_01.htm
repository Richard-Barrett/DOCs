Because of the complexities of the WorldWide Web, some of the issues mentioned in this chapter overlap withthose in other chapters in this book, most notably <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch06_01.htm"TITLE="Cryptography">Chapter 6, <CITECLASS="chapter">Cryptography</CITE></A>, <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch17_01.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Services">Chapter 17, <CITECLASS="chapter">TCP/IP Services</CITE></A>, and <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch23_01.htm"TITLE="Writing Secure SUID and Network Programs">Chapter 23, <CITECLASS="chapter">Writing Secure SUID and Network Programs</CITE></A>.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-18-SECT-1">18.1 Security and the World Wide Web</A></H2><PCLASS="para">The World Wide Web is a system for exchanging informationover the Internet. The Web is constructed from specially writtenprograms called <ICLASS="firstterm">Web servers</I> that make informationavailable on the network. Other programs, called <ICLASS="firstterm">Webbrowsers</I>, can be used to access the information thatis stored in the servers and to display it on the user'sscreen.</P><PCLASS="para">The World Wide Web was originally developed as a system forphysicists to exchange papers pertaining to their physics research.Using the Web enabled the physicists to short-circuit the costlyand often prolonged task of publishing research findings in paperscientific journals. Short-circuiting publishers remains one ofthe biggest uses of the Web today, with businesses, universities,government agencies, and even individuals publishing millions ofscreens of information about themselves and practically everythingelse. Many organizations also use the Web for distributing confidentialdocuments within their organization, and between their organizationand its customers.</P><PCLASS="para">Another exciting use of the Web today involves putting programsbehind Web pages. Programs are created with a protocol called the<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-24306"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-24308"></A>Common Gateway Interface (<SPANCLASS="acronym">CGI</SPAN>).<SPANCLASS="acronym">CGI</SPAN> scripts can be quite simple&nbsp;- forexample, a counter that increments every time a person looks atthe page, or a guest book that allows people to &quot;sign in&quot;to a site. Or they might be quite sophisticated. For example, theFedEx package-delivery service allows its customers to use the company'sWorld Wide Web server (<ACLASS="systemitem.url"HREF="http://www.fedex.com">http://www.fedex.com</A>) totrace packages. Giving customers access to its computers in thismanner simultaneously saves FedEx money and gives the customersbetter service.</P><PCLASS="para">Many other companies are now exploring the use of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN>for electronic commerce. Customers browse catalogs of goods andservices, select items, and then pay for them without anything otherthan a forms-capable browser.</P><PCLASS="para">The World Wide Web is one of the most exciting uses of theInternet. But it also poses profound security challenges. In orderof importance, these challenges are:</P><OLCLASS="orderedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">An attacker may take advantage of bugsin your Web server or in <SPANCLASS="acronym">CGI</SPAN> scripts to gainunauthorized access to other files on your system, or even to seizecontrol of the entire computer.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Confidential information that is on your Web servermay be distributed to unauthorized individuals.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Confidential information transmitted between theWeb server and the browser can be intercepted.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Bugs in your Web browser (or features you are notaware of) may allow confidential info on your Web client to be obtainedfrom a rogue Web server.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Because of the existence of standards and patentedtechnologies, many organizations have found it necessary to purchasespecially licensed software. This licensed software, in turn, cancreate its own unique vulnerabilities.</P></LI></OL><PCLASS="para">Each of these challenges requires its own response. Unfortunately,some of the solutions that are currently being employed are contradictory.For example, to minimize the risk of eavesdropping, many organizationshave purchased &quot;secure&quot; World Wide Web servers,which implement a variety of encryption protocols. But these serversrequire a digitally signed certificate to operate, and that certificatemust be renewed on an annual basis. Consequently, organizationsthat are dependent on their <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN> servers are exposedto interesting denial of service attacks.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="note"><PCLASS="para"><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> There are many Web servers currently in use, and therewill be even more in use within the months after this book is published.While we were working on this book, several groups distributingWeb servers announced or released several new versions of theirprograms.</P><PCLASS="para">It would be very difficult, and not very useful, for thischapter to discuss the specific details of specific Web servers.Besides the fact that there are too many of them, they are changingtoo fast, so any details included in this book would be out of datewithin a year of publication. The Internet is evolving too quicklyfor printed documentation to remain current.</P><PCLASS="para">For this reason, this chapter discusses Web security in fairlygeneral terms. Specific examples, where appropriate, use the <SPANCLASS="acronym">NCSA</SPAN>Web server (with brief mention of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">CERN</SPAN> andWN servers), with the understanding that other Web servers may havesimilar or different syntax.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><DIVCLASS="sidebar"><H4CLASS="sidebar"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-24337">Security Information on the WWW</A></H4><PCLASS="para">There are a few excellent resources on the World Wide Webpertaining to <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN> security issues.
