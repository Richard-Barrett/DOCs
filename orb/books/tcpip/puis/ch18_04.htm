Thereare only two ways to protect information from eavesdropping. Thefirst is to assure that the information travels over a physicallysecure network (which the Internet is not). The second is to encryptthe information so that it can only be decrypted by the intendedrecipient.</P><PCLASS="para">Another form of eavesdropping that is possible is <ICLASS="firstterm"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25304"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25306"></A>trafficanalysis</I>.

The message had been encrypted with theinternational version of the Netscape Navigator using a 40-bit RC4key. In the second case, a group of students at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley discovered a flaw in the random number generatorused by the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>-based version of Navigator.[3]In the third case, the same group of students at Berkeley discovereda way to alter the binaries of the Navigator program as they traveledbetween the university's <SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN> serverand the client workstation on which the program was actually running.[4]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[3] Therandom number generator was seeded with a number that depended onthe current time and the process number of the Navigator process.</P><PCLASS="para">[4] The students pointed out that while they attacked the Navigator'sbinaries as it was moving from the server computer to the client,they could have as easily have attacked the program as it was beingdownloaded from an FTP site.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">All of these attacks are highly sophisticated. Nevertheless,most of them do not seem to be having an impact on the commercialdevelopment of the Web. It is likely that within a few years theencryption keys will be lengthened to 64 bits. Netscape has improvedthe process by which its Navigator program seeds its random numbergenerator. The third problem, of binaries being surreptitiouslyaltered, will likely not be a problem for most users with improvedsoftware distribution systems that themselves use encryption anddigital signatures.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25417"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25420"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-18-SECT-4.2">18.4.2 Eavesdropping Through Log Files</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25426"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25429"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25432"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25435"></A>Most Web servers create log filesthat record considerable information about each request.
