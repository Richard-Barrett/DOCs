Although this is a good way to provideextensibility, you should not configure your Web browser so thatprograms downloaded from the net are automatically executed. Doingso poses a profound risk, because it provides a way for outsidersto run programs on your computer without your explicit permission.(For example, a program could be embedded in an <SPANCLASS="acronym">HTML</SPAN>page as an included &quot;image.&quot;)</P><PCLASS="para">In particular:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Do not configure <ICLASS="filename">/bin/csh</I> as a viewer for documents of type <ICLASS="filename">application/x-csh</I>.(The same is true with other shells.)</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Do not configure your Web browser to automaticallyrun spreadsheets or word processors, because most spreadsheets andword processors these days have the ability to embed executablecode within their files.

The creatorsof Java have gone to great lengths to make sure that a program writtenin Java cannot harm the computer on which it is running. Whetheror not the creators are correct remains to be seen. However, wehave our doubts based on past experiences with complex software.As this book goes to press, there is no indication that Java hasany significant protections against denial of service attacks. Also,as this book goes to press, several serious security bugs in Sun'sand Netscape's implementations of Java have been reported.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-18-SECT-5.2">18.5.2 Trusting Your Software Vendor</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25605"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25608"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25610"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25612"></A>Mostusers run Web browsers that are provided by third parties with whomthe user has no formal relationship or signed contract. Instead,users are asked to click buttons that say &quot;<SPANCLASS="acronym">ACCEPT</SPAN>&quot;to signify their acceptance of the terms of a non-negotiable licenseagreement. These license agreements limit the liability of the companiesthat distribute the software.</P><PCLASS="para">Individuals and organizations using such software should carefullyread the license agreements. They rarely do. In particular, considerthese two clauses in the Netscape Navigator 2.02b license.

We don't thinkthat Navigator actually has this code compiled into it, but we don'tknow, because Netscape has not published the source code for eitherits Navigator or Commerce Server. (Netscape is not alone in keepingits source code secret.)</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[5] We don't mean to pick on Netscapehere. Other software comes with similar license agreements. Netscapeis used merely as an illustrative example because of its popularitywhen this book was being written.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">We <EMCLASS="emphasis">do </EM>know, however, that users havereported some security lapses in 2.0beta Navigator having to dowith Netscape's <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25625"></A>LiveScript, renamed Java Script, programming language. A feature ina beta version of the browser allowed any server to query the Webbrowser for the list of <SPANCLASS="acronym">URLS</SPAN> that had been visitedby the user.[6]As <SPANCLASS="acronym">URLS</SPAN> can contain passwords, this posed serioussecurity issues. Although this feature has been taken out of Navigator,it is possible that it could be reintroduced in the future throughthe use of a programming language such as Java.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[6] This was reported by Scott Weston onthe <ICLASS="filename">comp.privacy</I> Usenet newsgroup on December 1, 1995.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Indeed, programming languages such as Java create a wholenew layer of security issues. Java is a programming language thatis designed to allow the downloading of applications over the WorldWide Web. Java is designed to be secure: the programs are run ona virtual machine, and they are not run unless they are approvedby a &quot;verifier&quot; on the Web browser. In the initialimplementation of Java for Web browsers, programs written in Javaare permitted to access the network or to touch the user'sfilesystem, but not both. Programs that can touch the filesystemare permitted to read any file, but only to write in a speciallypredetermined directory.</P><PCLASS="para">Unfortunately, Java's current security model is ratherrestrictive, and it is therefore quite likely that users will demanda more open model that gives Java programs more access to a user'sfilesystems <ICLASS="systemitem">and</I> thenetwork. This will probably produce a new round of security problems.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25635"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25638"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25640"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25642"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25645"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25648"></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch18_04.htm"TITLE="18.4 Avoiding the Risks of Eavesdropping"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 18.4 Avoiding the Risks of Eavesdropping"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch18_06.htm"TITLE="18.6 Dependence on Third Parties"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 18.6 Dependence on Third Parties"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">18.4 Avoiding the Risks of Eavesdropping</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">18.6 Dependence on Third Parties</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
