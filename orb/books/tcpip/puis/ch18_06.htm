Computers need electricity to run, which makesmost computer users dependent on their power company for continuedoperations. You can purchase an electrical generator or a solarpower system, but this simply shifts the dependence from the powercompany to the firm that supplies the fuel to the generator, orthe firm that makes replacement parts for the solar power system.[7]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[7] There is also a dependence on the continued operation of Solitself.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Most organizations attempt to limit their risk by arrangingfor multiple suppliers of their key resources. For example, youmight purchase your electricity from a utility, but have a dieselgenerator for backup. If you are a newspaper, you might have severalsuppliers for paper. That way, if you have a dispute with one supplier,you can still publish your newspaper by buying from another.</P><PCLASS="para">Likewise, it is important to be sure that you have multiplesuppliers for all of your key computer resources. It is unwise tobe in a position where the continued operation of your businessdepends on your continued relationship with an outside supplier,because this gives the supplier control over your business.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25661"></A>Today,there are many choices for organizations that are deploying Webservers. Web servers can be run on a wide variety of platforms,including <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>, Windows, and Macintosh. And thereare many different Web servers available for the same hardware.</P><PCLASS="para">There are fewer choices available when organizations needto purchase secure Web servers&nbsp;- that is, Web servers thatprovide for cryptographic protection of data and authenticationof their users. This restriction is a result of the fact that theuse of <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25666"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25668"></A>public-keycryptography in the United States will be covered by patents untilthe year 1997 (in the case of the <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25671"></A>Diffie-Hellman and <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25673"></A>Hellman-Merklepatents) or the year 2000 (in the case of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">RSA</SPAN>patent). Currently, the use of these patents is controlled by twocompanies, Cylink, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., and <SPANCLASS="acronym">RSA</SPAN>Data Security, based in Redwood City, California. Because of theexistence of these patents, and because of the widespread adoptionof the <SPANCLASS="acronym">RSA</SPAN> technology by the Web community, itis highly unlikely that a server that implements cryptographic securitywill be produced and sold in the United States that is not licensed,directly or indirectly, by <SPANCLASS="acronym">RSA</SPAN> Data Security.</P><PCLASS="para">One of the primary purposes of encryption is to provide absoluteassurances to consumers that when the consumer contacts a Web server,the Web server actually belongs to the company to which it claimsto belong. You can't trust the Web server itself. So companiessuch as Netscape Communications have turned to a trusted third party,<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-25680"></A>Verisign Inc. Netscape has embeddedVerisign's public key in both its Secure Commerce Serverand its Web browser. The browser will not switch into its secure,encrypted mode unless it is presented a digital ID from the serverthat is signed by Verisign's secret key.</P><PCLASS="para">And Netscape is not alone. At the time of this writing (December1995), all secure Web servers and browsers used Verisign as theirtrusted certification authority. Although there are plans for othersuch authorities, none currently exist.</P><PCLASS="para">This presents businesses with a dilemma. The reason is thatdigital ID's signed by Verisign must be renewed every yearto remain valid. But Verisign is under no legal obligation to renewthe IDs. This means that, should a dispute arise between Verisignand a company using a secure Web browser, Verisign could simplychoose not to renew the company's key, and the companywould lose the cryptographic capabilities of its program. Note thisis not a problem with Verisign, per se, but with the whole schemeof certification authorities with whom you have no direct contractualrelationship.</P><PCLASS="para">There are several solutions to this problem. The obvious oneis for there to be alternative certification authorities, and forbrowsers and servers to accept digital identification credentialsfrom any certification authority, giving the user the choice ofwhether or not the authority should be trusted. We have been toldthat these changes will be made in a future version of Netscape'sNavigator. But we include this discussion to illustrate the riskof depending on third parties. Even if these risks are minimizedin the Netscape products, third-party dependencies are likely tocontinue in many different forms. Be on the lookout for them!</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch18_05.htm"TITLE="18.5 Risks of Web Browsers"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 18.5 Risks of Web Browsers"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch18_07.htm"TITLE="18.7 Summary"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 18.7 Summary"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">18.5 Risks of Web Browsers</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">18.7 Summary</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
