Nevertheless,the commands continue to start with the letters &quot;yp.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Sun was not the first company to developa network-based operating system, nor was Sun's approachtechnically the most sophisticated. One of the most important featuresthat was missing was security: Sun's <SPANCLASS="acronym">RPC</SPAN>and <SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN> had virtually none, effectively throwingopen the resources of a computer system to the whims of the network'susers.</P><PCLASS="para">Despite this failing (or perhaps, because ofit), Sun's technology soon became the standard. Soon theUniversity of California at Berkeley developed an implementationof <SPANCLASS="acronym">RPC</SPAN>, <SPANCLASS="acronym">NIS</SPAN>, and <SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN>that interoperated with Sun's. As <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>workstations became more popular, other companies, such as HP, Digital,and even <SPANCLASS="acronym">IBM</SPAN> either licensed or adopted Berkeley'ssoftware, licensed Sun's, or developed their own.</P><PCLASS="para">Overtime, Sun developed some fixes for the security problems in <SPANCLASS="acronym">RPC</SPAN>and <SPANCLASS="acronym">NFS</SPAN>. Meanwhile, a number of other competingand complementary systems&nbsp;- for example, Kerberos and <SPANCLASS="acronym">DCE</SPAN>&nbsp;- weredeveloped for solving many of the same problems. As a result, today'ssystem manager has a choice of many different systems for remoteprocedure calls and configuration management, each with its owntrade-offs in terms of performance, ease of administration, andsecurity. This chapter describes the main systems available todayand makes a variety of observations on system security.

A systemcan provide for client authentication and user authentication, butalso require that the clients implicitly trust that the serverson the network are, in fact, legitimate servers. A system can providefor authentication of the users and the computers, but send allinformation without encryption or digital signatures, making itsusceptible to modification or monitoring <EMCLASS="emphasis">en route</EM>.</P><PCLASS="para">Obviously, the most secure network systems provideall five network security capabilities.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch18_07.htm"TITLE="18.7 Summary"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 18.7 Summary"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch19_02.htm"TITLE="19.2 Sun's Remote Procedure Call (RPC)"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 19.2 Sun's Remote Procedure Call (RPC)"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">18.7 Summary</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">19.2 Sun's Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
