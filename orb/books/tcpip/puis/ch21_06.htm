While they are an interesting technology, they are nota cure-all for network security problems. They also are being usedto connect many networks to the Internet that should not necessarilybe connected. So before you run out and invest your time and moneyin a firewall solution, consider these points:</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-21-SECT-6.1">21.6.1 Firewalls Can Be Dangerous</A></H3><PCLASS="para">We startedthe chapter by pointing out that a firewall is not a panacea. Wewill conclude the chapter by making the point again: firewalls canbe a big help in ensuring the security of your network; however,a misconfigured firewall, or a firewall with poor per-host controls,may actually be <EMCLASS="emphasis">worse</EM> than no firewall at all.With no firewall in place, you will at least be more concerned abouthost security and monitoring. Unfortunately, at many sites, managementmay be lulled into believing that their systems are secure afterthey have paid for the installation of a significant firewall&nbsp;- especiallyif they are only exposed to the advertising hype of the vendor andconsultants.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-21-SECT-6.2">21.6.2 Firewalls Sometimes Fail</A></H3><PCLASS="para">The truth ofthe matter is that a firewall is only one component of good security.And it is a component that is only effective against external threats.Insider attacks are seldom affected in any way by a firewall. Collusionof an insider and an outsider can circumvent a firewall in shortorder. And bugs, misconfiguration problems, or equipment failuremay all result in a temporary failure of the firewall you have inplace. One single user, anywhere &quot;inside&quot; yournetwork, can also unwittingly compromise the entire firewall schemeby connecting a modem to a desktop workstation ... and youwill not likely know about the compromise until you are requiredto clean up the resulting break in.</P><PCLASS="para">Does this case soundunlikely? It isn't. Richard Power of the Computer SecurityInstitute (<SPANCLASS="acronym">CSI</SPAN>) surveyed more than 320 Fortune500 computer sites about their experiences with firewalls. His surveyresults were released in September of 1995 and revealed that 20%of all sites had experienced a computer security incident. Interestingly,30% of the Internet security incidents reported by respondentsoccurred <EMCLASS="emphasis">after</EM> the installation of a firewall.This incident rate is probably a combined result of misconfiguration,unmonitored back door connections, and other difficulties. </P><PCLASS="para">The <SPANCLASS="acronym">CSI</SPAN> study raised a number of questions:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Perhaps the firewall installationat some sites was faulty, or too permissive.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Perhaps users internal to the organization foundways to circumvent the firewall by connecting unauthorized modemsto the network, thus creating back doors into the network.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Perhaps the use of firewalls resulted in feelingsof overconfidence and a resulting relaxation of other, more traditionalcontrols, thus leading to problems.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Perhaps the sites using the firewalls are more attractivetargets than sites without firewalls, and thus attract more attacks.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Perhaps, as suggested by many other studies, themajority of incidents continue to be caused by insiders, and theseare not stopped by firewalls.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Perhaps the sites didn't really have afirewall. Over 50% of the companies that claimed to havea &quot;firewall&quot; merely had a screening router.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">The key conclusion to be drawn from all of this informationis that one or more network firewalls may help your security, butyou should plan the rest of your security so that your systems willstill be protected in the event that your firewall fails.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-21-SECT-6.3">21.6.3 Do You Really Need Your Desktop Machines  on theInternet?</A></H3><PCLASS="para">Let us conclude by reiterating somethingwe said earlier&nbsp;- if you have no network connection, youdon't need an external firewall. The question you reallyshould ask before designing a firewall strategy is: what is to begained from having the connection to the outside, and who is drivingthe connection? This question revisits the basic issues of policyand risk assessment discussed in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch02_01.htm"TITLE="Policies and Guidelines">Chapter 2, <CITECLASS="chapter">Policies and Guidelines</CITE></A>.</P><PCLASS="para">At manylocations, users are clamoring for Internet access because theywant access to Usenet news, entertaining mailing lists, personalemail, and <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN> on their desktop. However, employeesoften do not want access to these services for purposes that arework related or work enhancing. Indeed, many organizations are nowrestricting in-house access to those services because employeesare wasting too much time on them. Rather than having full networkaccess to your entire corporate network, you might consider usingone approach for users who need Internet access, and a differentapproach for users who simply want Internet access. For example:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Have a disconnected network of a smallnumber of machines that are connected to the Internet. Users whoreally need Internet access are given accounts on these machinesfor as long as they continue to need access. A tape drive or serial-line<SPANCLASS="acronym">UUCP</SPAN> connection is made available to transferfiles between these machines and the internal network without exposingall the internal nodes to IP-based attacks.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Use a hard-wired <SPANCLASS="acronym">UUCP</SPAN> connectionto transfer email between your internal network and the Internet.This connection will allow your employees to exchange email withother sites for work-related purposes, but will not expose yournetwork to IP-based attacks.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Provide remaining users with some form of accountaccess through an <SPANCLASS="acronym">ISP</SPAN> outside your company. Then,on their own time, your employees can access the Internet (and possiblysome other special services). If you negotiate with the <SPANCLASS="acronym">ISP</SPAN>for a large block of accounts for your employees, you may be ableto get a very good rate. The rate may be so good, in fact, thatyou may wish to use company funds to subsidize the accounts, andhave low-cost personal Internet access (at home) be another benefitfor working at your company. This solution is probably cheaper thana firewall, a major break-in, and the time lost to employees surfingthe <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN> at work.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">Remember that the best firewall is still a large air gap betweenthe network and any of your computers, and that a pair of wire cuttersremains the most effective network protection mechanism.[14]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[14] Thanks to Steve Bellovin for this observation.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch21_05.htm"TITLE="21.5 Special Considerations"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 21.5 Special Considerations"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="CHAPTER"HREF="ch22_01.htm"TITLE="22.
