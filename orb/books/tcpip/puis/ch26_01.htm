Perhaps an ex-employee has broken in throughan old account and has deleted some records. Perhaps someone fromoutside continues to try to break into your system despite warningsthat they should stop. What recourse do you have through the courts?Furthermore, what are some of the particular dangers you may facefrom the legal system during the normal operation of your computersystem? What happens if <EMCLASS="emphasis">you</EM> are the targetof legal action?</P><PCLASS="para">This chapter attempts to illuminatesome of these issues. The material we present should be viewed asgeneral advice, and not as legal opinion: for that, you should contactgood legal counsel and have them advise you.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-26-SECT-1">26.1 Legal Options After a Break-in</A></H2><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35045"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35048"></A>Youhave a variety of different recourses under the U.S. legal systemfor dealing with a break-in. A brief chapter such as this one cannotadvise you on the subtle aspects of the law. Every situation isdifferent. Furthermore, there are differences between state andFederal law, as well as different laws that apply to computer systemsused for different purposes. Laws outside the U.S. vary considerablyfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction; we won't attempt toexplain anything beyond the U.S. system.[1]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] An excellentdiscussion of legal issues in the U.S. can be found in <EMCLASS="emphasis">Computer Crime: A Crimefighter's Handbook</EM> (O'Reilly &amp;Associates. 1995), and we suggest you start there if you need moreexplanation than we provide in this chapter.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">You should discuss your specific situation with a competentlawyer before pursuing <EMCLASS="emphasis">any</EM> legal recourse. As there are difficultiesand dangers associated with legal approaches, you should also besure that you want to pursue this course of action before you goahead.</P><PCLASS="para">In some cases, you may have no choice; youmay be required to pursue legal means. For example:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If you want to file a claim againstyour <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35060"></A>insurance policy to receivemoney for damages resulting from a break-in, you may be requiredby your insurance company to pursue criminal or civil actions againstthe perpetrators.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If you are involved with <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35064"></A>classified data processing, you may be requiredby government regulations to report and investigate suspicious activity.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If you are aware of criminal activity and you donot report it (and especially if your computer is being used forthat activity), you may be criminally liable as an accessory.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If your computer is being used for certain formsof unlawful or inappropriate activity and you do not take definitiveaction, you may be named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit seekingpunitive damages for that activity.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If you are an executive and decide not to investigateand prosecute illegal activity, shareholders in your corporationcan bring suit against you.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">Ifyou believe that your system is at risk, you should probably seeklegal advice before a break-in actually occurs. By doing so, youwill know ahead of time the course of action to take if an incidentoccurs.</P><PCLASS="para">To give you some starting points for discussion,this chapter provides an overview of the two primary legal approachesyou can employ, and some of the features and difficulties that accompanyeach one.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch25_03.htm"TITLE="25.3 Network Denial of Service Attacks"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 25.3 Network Denial of Service Attacks"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch26_02.htm"TITLE="26.2 Criminal Prosecution"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 26.2 Criminal Prosecution"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">25.3 Network Denial of Service Attacks</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">26.2 Criminal Prosecution</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
