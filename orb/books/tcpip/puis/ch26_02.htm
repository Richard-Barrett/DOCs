You start the processby making a formal complaint to a law-enforcement agency. A prosecutorwill likely decide if the allegations should be investigated andwhat (if any) charges should be filed.</P><PCLASS="para">In some cases(perhaps a majority of them), criminal investigation will not helpyour situation. If the perpetrators have left little trace of theiractivity and the activity is not likely to recur, or if the perpetratorsare entering your system through a computer in a foreign country,you are not likely to trace or arrest the individuals involved.Many experienced computer intruders will leave little tracing evidencebehind.[2]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[2] Although few computer intruders are as cleveras they believe themselves to be.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Thereis no guarantee that a criminal investigation will ever result froma complaint that you file. The prosecutor involved (Federal, state,or local) will need to decide which, if any, laws have been broken,the seriousness of the crime, the availability of trained investigators,and the probability of a conviction. Remember that the criminaljustice system is very overloaded; new investigations are startedonly for very severe violations of the law or for cases that warrantspecial treatment. A case in which $200,000 worth of datais destroyed is more likely to be investigated than is a case inwhich someone is repeatedly trying to break the password of yourhome computer.</P><PCLASS="para">Investigations can also place you inan uncomfortable and possibly dangerous position. If unknown partiesare continuing to break into your system by remote means, law-enforcementauthorities may ask you to leave your system open, thus allowingthe investigators to trace the connection and gather evidence foran arrest. Unfortunately, if you leave your system open after discoveringthat it is being misused, and the perpetrator uses your system tobreak into or damage another system elsewhere, you may be the targetof a third-party lawsuit. Cooperating with law-enforcement agentsis not a sufficient shield from such liability. Before putting yourselfat risk in this way, you should discuss alternatives with your lawyer.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-26-SECT-2.1">26.2.1 The Local Option</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35092"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35095"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35097"></A>Oneof the first things you must decide is to whom you should reportthe crime. Usually, you should deal with local or state authorities,if at all possible. Every state currently has laws against somesort of computer crime. If your local law-enforcement personnelbelieve that the crime is more appropriately investigated by theFederal government, they will suggest that you contact Federal authorities.</P><PCLASS="para">You cannot be sure whether your problem will receivemore attention from local authorities or from Federal authorities.Local authorities may be more responsive because you are not aslikely to be competing with a large number of other cases (as frequentlyoccurs at the Federal level). Local authorities may also be morelikely to be interested in your problems, no matter how small theproblems may be. At the same time, local authorities may be reluctantto take on high-tech investigations where they have little expertise.[3] ManyFederal agencies have expertise that can be brought in quickly tohelp deal with a problem. One key difference is that investigationand prosecution of juveniles is more likely to be done by stateauthorities than by Federal authorities.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[3] Although in some venues, there are <EMCLASS="emphasis">very</EM>experienced local law-enforcement officers, and they may be moreexperienced than a typical Federal officer.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Some locallaw-enforcement agencies may be reluctant to seek outside help orto bring in Federal agents. This may keep your particular case frombeing investigated properly.</P><PCLASS="para">In many areas, becausethe local authorities do not have the expertise or background necessaryto investigate and prosecute computer-related crimes, you may findthat they must depend on you for your expertise. In many cases,you will be involved with the investigation on an ongoing basis&nbsp;- possiblyto a great extent. You may or may not consider this a productiveuse of your time.</P><PCLASS="para">Our best advice is to contact locallaw enforcement before any problem occurs, and get some idea oftheir expertise and willingness to help you in the event of a problem.The time you invest up front could pay big dividends later on ifyou need to decide who to call at 2 a.m. on a holiday because youhave found evidence that someone is making unauthorized use of yoursystem.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-26-SECT-2.2">26.2.2 Federal Jurisdiction</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35110"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35112"></A>Although youmight often prefer to deal with local authorities, you should contactFederal authorities if you:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Are working with <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35118"></A>classified or military information</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Have involvement with nuclear materials or information</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Work for a Federal agency and its equipment is involved</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Work for a bank or handle regulated financial information</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Are involved with interstate telecommunications</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Believe that people from out of the state or outof the country are involved with the crime</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35131"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35133"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35135"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35138"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35140"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35142"></A>Offenses related to national security,fraud, or telecommunications are usually handled by the <SPANCLASS="acronym">FBI</SPAN>.Cases involving financial institutions, stolen access codes, orpasswords are generally handled by the <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35146"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35148"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35150"></A>U.S.Secret Service.

We also expect some existing laws to be modified toextend coverage to certain forms of data used on computers.

Sadly, there are still many Federalagents who are not well versed with computers and computer crime.In most local jurisdictions, there may be even less expertise. Yourcase will be probably be investigated by an agent who has littleor no training in computing.</P><PCLASS="para">Computer-illiterate agentswill sometimes seek your assistance and try to understand the subtletiesof the case. Other times, they will ignore helpful advice&nbsp;- perhapsto hide their own ignorance&nbsp;- often to the detriment of thecase and to the reputation of the law-enforcement community.</P><PCLASS="para">If you or your personnel are asked to assist in the executionof a <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35247"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35249"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35251"></A>searchwarrant, to help identify material to be searched, be sure thatthe court order directs such &quot;expert&quot; involvement.Otherwise, you may find yourself complicating the case by appearingas an overzealous victim. You will usually benefit by recommendingan impartial third party to assist the law-enforcement agents.</P><PCLASS="para">The attitude and behavior of the law-enforcement officerscan cause you major problems. <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35255"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35258"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35260"></A>Yourequipment might be seized as evidence, or held for an unreasonablelength of time for examination. If you are the victim and are reportingthe case, the authorities will usually make every attempt to coordinatetheir examinations with you, to cause you the least amount of inconvenience.However, if the perpetrators are your employees, or if regulatedinformation is involved (bank, military, etc.), you might have nocontrol over the manner or duration of the examination of your systemsand media. This problem becomes more severe if you are dealing withagents who need to seek expertise outside their local offices toexamine the material. Be sure to keep track of <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35263"></A>downtime during an investigationas it may be included as part of the damage during prosecution andany subsequent civil suit.</P><PCLASS="para">An investigation is anothersituation in which <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35267"></A>backupscan be extremely valuable. You might even make use of your disaster-recoveryplan, and use a standby or spare site while your regular systemis being examined.</P><PCLASS="para">Heavy-handed or inept investigativeefforts may also place you in an uncomfortable position with respectto the computer community. Attitudes directed toward law-enforcementofficers can easily be redirected toward you. Such attitudes canplace you in a worse light than you deserve, and may hinder notonly cooperation with the current investigation, but also with otherprofessional activities. Furthermore, they may make you a targetfor electronic attack or other forms of abuse after the investigationconcludes. These attitudes are unfortunate, because there are somevery good investigators, and careful investigation and prosecutionmay be needed to stop malicious or persistent intruders.</P><PCLASS="para">Forthese reasons, we encourage you to carefully consider the decisionto involve law-enforcement agencies with any security problem pertainingto your system. In most cases, we suggest that you may not wantto involve the criminal justice system at all unless a real losshas occurred, or unless you are unable to control the situationon your own. In some instances, the publicity involved in a casemay be more harmful than the loss you have sustained. However, beaware that the problem you spot may be part of a much larger problemthat is ongoing or beginning to develop. You may be risking furtherdamage and delay if you decide to ignore the situation.</P><PCLASS="para">Wewish to stress the positive. Law-enforcement agencies are awareof the need to improve how they investigate computer crime cases,and they are working to develop in-service training, forensic analysisfacilities, and other tools to help them conduct effective investigations.In many jurisdictions (especially in high-tech areas of the country),investigators and prosecutors have gained considerable experienceand have worked to convey that information to their peers. The resultis a significant improvement in law enforcement effectiveness overthe last few years, with a number of successful investigations andprosecutions. You should very definitely think about the positiveaspects of reporting a computer crime&nbsp;-  not only for yourself,but for the community as a whole. Successful prosecutions may helpdissuade further misuse of your system and of others' systems.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-26-SECT-2.5">26.2.5 If You or One of Your Employees Is a Target  ofan Investigation...</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35276"></A>If law-enforcement officials believethat your computer system has been used by an employee to breakinto other computer systems, to transmit or store controlled information(trade secrets, child pornography, etc.), or to otherwise participatein some computer crime, you may find your computers impounded bya search warrant (criminal cases) or writ of seizure (civil cases).If you can document that your employee has had limited access toyour systems, and if you present that information during the search,it may help limit the scope of the confiscation. However, you maystill be in a position in which some of your equipment is confiscatedas part of a legal search.</P><PCLASS="para">Local police or Federalauthorities can present a judge with a petition to grant a <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35280"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35282"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35284"></A>search warrantif they believe there is evidence to be found concerning a violationof a law. If the warrant is in order, the judge will almost alwaysgrant the search warrant. Currently, a few Federal investigatorsand law-enforcement personnel in some states have a poor reputationfor heavy-handed and excessively broad searches. The scope of thesearch is usually detailed in the warrant by the agent in chargeand approved by the judge; most warrants are derived from &quot;boilerplate&quot; examples that are themselves too broad. These problemshave resulted in considerable ill will, and in the future mightresult in evidence not being admissible on Constitutional groundsbecause a search was too wide-ranging. How to define the properscope of a search is still a matter of some evolution in the courts.</P><PCLASS="para">Usually, the police seek to confiscate anything connectedwith the computer that may have evidence (e.g., files with stolensource code or telephone access codes). This confiscation mightresult in seizure of the computer, all magnetic media that couldbe used with the computer, anything that could be used as an externalstorage peripheral (e.g., videotape machines and tapes), auto-dialersthat could contain phone numbers for target systems in their battery-backedmemory, printers and other peripherals necessary to examine yoursystem (in case it is nonstandard in setup), and all documentationand printouts. In past investigations, even laser printers, answeringmachines, and televisions have been seized by Federal agents.</P><PCLASS="para">Officers are required to give a receipt for what they take.However, you may wait a very long time before you get your equipmentback, especially if there is a lot of storage media involved, orif the officers are not sure what they are looking for. Your equipmentmay not even be returned in working condition&nbsp;- batteriesdischarge, media degrades, and dust works its way into moving parts.</P><PCLASS="para">You should discuss the return of your equipment duringthe execution of the warrant, or thereafter with the prosecutors.You should indicate priorities (and reasons) for the items to bereturned. In most cases, you can request copies of critical dataand programs. As the owner of the equipment, you can also file suit[4] to have it returned,but such suits may drag on and may not be productive. Suits to recoverdamages may not be allowed against law-enforcement agencies thatare pursuing a legitimate investigation.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[4] If it is a Federal warrant, your lawyer may file a &quot;Motionfor Return of Property&quot; under Rule 41(e) of the FederalRules of Criminal Procedure.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">You can alsochallenge the reasons used to file the warrant and seek to haveit declared invalid, forcing the return of your equipment. However,in some cases, warrants have been sealed to protect ongoing investigationsand informants, so this option can be made much more difficult toexecute. Equipment and media seized during a search may be helduntil a trial if they contain material to be used as prosecutionevidence. Some state laws require forfeiture of the equipment onconviction.</P><PCLASS="para">At present, a search is not likely to involveconfiscation of a mainframe or even a minicomputer. However, confiscationof tapes, disks, and printed material could disable your businesseven if the computer itself is not taken. Having full backups offsitemay not be sufficient protection, because tapes might also be takenby a search warrant. If you think that a search might curtail yourlegitimate business, be sure that the agents conducting the searchhave detailed information regarding which records are vital to yourongoing operation and request copies from them.</P><PCLASS="para">Untilthe law is better defined in this area, you are well advised toconsult with your attorney if you are at all worried that a confiscationmight occur. Furthermore, if you have homeowners' or businessinsurance, you might check with your agent to see if it covers damagesresulting from law-enforcement agents during an investigation. Businessinterruption insurance provisions should also be checked if yourbusiness depends on your computer. <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35295"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-26-SECT-2.6">26.2.6 Other Tips</A></H3><PCLASS="para">Here is a summary of additionalobservations about the application of criminal law to deter possibleabuse of your computer.
