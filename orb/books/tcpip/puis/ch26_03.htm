The nature of lawsuits is such that you can basicallysue anyone for any reasonable claim of damages or injury. You caneven sue parties unknown, as long as some hope exists of identifyingthem at a later time. You can ask for actual and punitive paymentof damages, injunctive relief (cease-and-desist orders), as wellas other remedies for damage. Often, a case is easier to prove ina civil court than in a criminal court. Civil cases require a lessstrict standard of proof to convict than do criminal cases (a &quot;preponderanceof the evidence&quot; as opposed to the &quot;beyond a reasonabledoubt&quot; standard used in criminal cases).</P><PCLASS="para">Civilremedies are much easier to get after a criminal conviction is obtained.</P><PCLASS="para">However, filing civil suits for damages in the caseof break-ins or unauthorized activity may not be a practical courseof action for several reasons:</P><OLCLASS="orderedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Civil suits can be very expensive topursue. Criminal cases are prosecuted by a government unit, andevidence collection and trial preparation are paid for by the government.In a civil case, the gathering of evidence and the preparation oftrial material is done by your lawyers&nbsp;- and you pay forit. Good lawyers still charge more than most computer consultants;therefore, the cost of preparing even a minor suit may be quitehigh. If you win your case, you may be able to have your lawyers'fees included in your award, but don't count on such provisions.Note, however, that criminal cases may sometimes be used as thebasis for later civil action.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">The preparation and scheduling of a lawsuit maytake many years. In the meantime, unless you are able to get temporaryinjunctions, whatever behavior that you are seeking to punish maycontinue. The delay can also continue to increase the cost of yourpreparation.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">You may not win a civil case. Even if you do win,it's possible that your opponent will not have any resourceswith which to pay damages or your lawyer fees, and so you thereforemay be out a considerable sum of money without any satisfactionother than the moral victory of a court decision in your favor.What's more, your opponent can always appeal&nbsp;- orcountersue.</P></LI></OL><PCLASS="para">The vast majorityof civil cases are settled out of court. Simply beginning the processof bringing suit may be sufficient to force your opponent into asettlement. If all you are seeking is to stop someone from breakinginto your system, or force someone to repay you for stolen computertime or documents, a lawsuit may be an appropriate course of action.In many cases, especially those involving juveniles trying to breakinto your system, having a lawyer send an official letter of complaintdemanding an immediate stop to the activity may be a cheap and effectiveway of achieving your goal.</P><PCLASS="para">As with other legal matters,you should consult with a trained attorney to discuss trade-offsand alternatives. There is a wide range of possibilities availableto you depending on your locale, the nature of your complaint, andthe nature of your opponent (business, individual, etc.).</P><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Neverthreaten a lawsuit without prior legal advice.</EM> Such threatsmay lead to problems you don't need&nbsp;- or want. <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35397"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35399"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch26_02.htm"TITLE="26.2 Criminal Prosecution"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 26.2 Criminal Prosecution"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch26_04.htm"TITLE="26.4 Other Liability"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 26.4 Other Liability"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">26.2 Criminal Prosecution</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">26.4 Other Liability</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
