We cannot hope to provide information here that willbe up-to-date for very long. For instance, one outstanding referencein this area, Internet &amp; Network Law 1995, by William J.Cook[5]summarizes some of the recent rulings incomputer and network law in the year 1995. Mr. Cook's reporthas almost 70 pages of case summaries and incidents, all of whichrepresent recent decisions. As more people use computers and networks,and as more commercial interests are tied into computing, we canexpect the pace of new legislation, legal decisions, and other actionsto increase. Therefore, as with any other aspect of the law, youare advised to seek competent legal counsel if you have any questionsabout whether these concerns may apply to you.[6]Keep in mind that the law functions with a logic all its own&nbsp;- onethat is puzzling and confounding to people who work with software.The law is not necessarily logical and fair, nor does it alwaysembody common sense.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[5] Of the law firm Willian Brinks Hofer Gilson &amp;Lione in Chicago.</P><PCLASS="para">[6] Anddon't make it a one-time visit, either. With the rapidpace of change, you need to track the changes if there is any chancethat you might be affected by adverse changes in the law.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-26-SECT-4.1">26.4.1 Munitions Export</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35420"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35422"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35424"></A>In <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch06_07.htm#PUIS-CHP-6-SECT-7.2"TITLE="Cryptography and Export Controls">Section 6.7.2, "Cryptography and Export Controls"</A>, we described someof the export control regulations in effect in the United States.Although largely quite silly and short-sighted, they are nonethelessthe law and you may encounter problems if you are in violation.</P><PCLASS="para">One reading of the regulations suggests that anyonewho exports <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35429"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35432"></A>encryptionsoftware outside the country, or makes it available to foreign nationalswho are not permanent residents, is in violation of the statutesunless a license is obtained first; such licenses are notoriouslydifficult to obtain. It may also be the case that granting accessto certain forms of advanced supercomputing equipment (even grantingaccounts) to foreign nationals is in violation of the law.</P><PCLASS="para">Youmay believe that you are not exporting any prohibited software.However, stop and think for a moment. Does your anonymous <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN>repository contain encryption software of any kind? Does your <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN>server have any pages with encryption software? Do you run a mailinglist or remailer that can be used to send encryption software outsidethe U.S.? If the answer to any of those is &quot;yes,&quot;you should consider seeking legal advice on this issue as you maybe classified as an &quot;exporter.&quot; Violation of theexport control acts are punishable (upon conviction) with heftyfines and long jail terms.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35439"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35442"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35445"></A>A further potentialviolation involves access to the software by non-citizens. If anyof your employees (or students) are not U.S. citizens or permanentresidents, and if they have access to encryption software or advancedcomputing hardware, you are likely to be in violation of the law.Note that one interpretation of the law implies that if you onlyprovide an account that is used by someone else to obtain controlledsoftware you may still be liable. (If you do, you are probably ingood company, because nearly all major universities and softwarevendors in the country are in the same position. This fact may belittle comfort if Federal agents show up at your door, however.)</P><PCLASS="para">An even more bizarre and interesting aspect of the law indicatesthat you may be in violation of the export control laws if you provideencryption software to U.S. citizens living and working in the U.S.&nbsp;- providedthat they are working for a company under non-U.S. control. Thus,even if you are a U.S. citizen, and you download a copy of <SPANCLASS="acronym">PGP</SPAN>or <SPANCLASS="acronym">DES</SPAN> to your workstation in your office (inWashington, Chicago, Atlanta, Houston, Phoenix, Portland, Los Angeles,Fairbanks, or Honolulu), you are now an international arms exporterand potential criminal if your company is majority owned or controlledby parties outside the U.S. This liability is personal, not corporate.</P><PCLASS="para">The whole matter of export controls on encryption softwareis under study by various government groups, and is the subjectof several lawsuits in Federal court. The status of this situationwill undoubtedly change in the next few years. We hope that it willchange to something more reasonable, but you should be sure to stayinformed.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-26-SECT-4.2">26.4.2 Copyright Infringement</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35455"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35457"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35460"></A>Items otherthan software can be copyrighted. Images in your <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN>pages, sound clips played through your gopher and <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN>servers, and documents you copied from other sites to pad your owncollection all have copyrights associated with them. On-line databases,computer programs, and electronic mail are copyrighted as well.The law states that as soon as something is expressed in a tangibleform, it has a copyright associated with it. Thus, as soon as thebits are on your disk, they are copyrighted, whether a formal noticeexists or not.</P><PCLASS="para">The standard practice on the Internethas been that something exported with a public-access server isfor public use, unless otherwise noted. However, this practice isnot in keeping with the way the law is currently phrased. Furthermore,some items that you obtain from an intermediate party may have hadowner and copyright information removed. This does not absolve youof any copyright liability if you use that material.</P><PCLASS="para">Inparticular, recent rulings in various courts have found that undercertain circumstances system operators can be sued as a contributingparty, and thus held partially liable, for copyright infringementcommitted by users of their systems. Types of infringement include:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Posting pictures, artwork, and imageson <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN> sites and <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN> siteswithout appropriate permission, even if the items are not clearlyidentified regarding owner, subject, or copyright.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Posting excerpts from books, reports, and othercopyrighted materials via mail, <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN>, or Usenetpostings.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Posting sound clips from films, TV shows, or otherrecorded media without approval of the copyright holders.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Posting scanned-in cartoons from newspapers or magazines.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Reposting news articles from copyrighted sources.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35483"></A>Repostingof email. Like paper mail, email has a copyright held by the authorof the email as soon as it is put in tangible form. The act of sendingthe mail to someone does not give the recipient copyright interestin the email. Standard practice on the net is not in keeping withthe way the law is written. Thus, forwarding email may technicallybe a violation of the copyright law.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">The best defense against possible lawsuits is to carefullyscreen everything you post or make available to be certain you knowits copyright status. Furthermore, make all your users aware ofthe policy you set in this regard, and then periodically audit toensure that the policy is followed. Having an unenforced policywill likely serve you as well as no policy&nbsp;-  that is, notat all.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35488"></A>Also, bewareof &quot;amateur lawyers&quot; who tell you that reuse ofan image or article is &quot;fair use&quot; under the law.There is a very precise definition of fair use, and you should getthe opinion from a real lawyer who knows the issues. After all,if you get sued, do you think that a reference to an anonymous postin the <EMCLASS="emphasis">alt.erotica.lawyers.briefs</EM> Usenet newsgroup is going to convincethe judge that you took due diligence to adhere to the law?</P><PCLASS="para">If anyone notifies you that you are violating their copyrightwith something you have on your system, you should investigate <EMCLASS="emphasis">immediately</EM>.Any delay could cause additional problems.

Although each individualact of unauthorized software copying and use may only deprive thevendor of a few hundred dollars at most, the sheer numbers of softwarepirates in operation makes the aggregate losses staggering: worldwidelosses are estimated in the billions of dollars per year. Figuresfrom various sources cited by Mr. Cook in Internet &amp; NetworkLaw 1995 indicate:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Worldwide losses from software piracyalone may be as high as $15 billion per year.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">94% of the software in the Peoples Republicof China is pirated.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">92% of the software in use in Japan ispirated.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">50% of the software in use in Canada ispirated.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">Although there arecriminal penalties for unauthorized copying, these penalties areonly employed against organized software piracy organizations. Instead,<SPANCLASS="acronym">SPA</SPAN> and others rely on civil-law remedies. Inparticular, the <SPANCLASS="acronym">SPA</SPAN> can obtain a court orderto examine your computer systems for evidence of unlicensed copiesof software. Should such copies be found without supporting documentationto show valid licenses, you may be subject to a lawsuit resultingin substantial damages. Many companies and universities have settledwith the <SPANCLASS="acronym">SPA</SPAN> with regard to these issues, withfines totaling in the many hundreds of thousands of dollars. Thisamount is in addition to the many thousands of dollars paid to vendorsfor any unlicensed software that is found.</P><PCLASS="para">Althoughthe <SPANCLASS="acronym">SPA</SPAN> has primarily been focused on softwarepiracy in the PC domain, they will probably expand their scope intothe <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> marketplace as more shrink-wrapped softwarebecomes available for <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> machines. Of additionalconcern are the new generations of emulators that let your <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>machine operate as a &quot;PC&quot; inside a window on yourworkstation. These emulators run PC software as well as (and sometimesfaster than) a plain desktop PC. The danger is having unlicensedPC software on your workstations for use in these emulators.</P><PCLASS="para">A further danger involves your users. If some of your usersare running a clandestine &quot;warez&quot; site from your<SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN> server, the <SPANCLASS="acronym">SPA</SPAN> or vendorsmight conceivably seek financial redress from you to help coverthe loss, even if you do not know about the server and otherwisedon't condone the behavior.[7]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[7] Whether theywould succeed in such an action is something we cannot know. However,almost anything is possible if a talented attorney were to pressthe case.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Your best defense in thesecircumstances is to clearly state to your users that no unlicenseduse or possession of software is allowed under any circumstances.Having internal audits of software is one way you can check compliancewith this policy. If software cannot be documented as paid for andoriginal, then it should be deleted. Having up-to-date and per-machinelog books is one way to track versions of software.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35536"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35538"></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-26-SECT-4.3">26.4.3 Trademark Violations</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35544"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35546"></A>Notethat use of trademark phrases, symbols, and insignia without thepermission of the holders of the trademark may lead to difficulties.In particular, don't put corporate logos on your <SPANCLASS="acronym">WWW</SPAN>pages without permission from the corporations involved.

Firms and individualsare applying for (and receiving) patents on software and algorithmsat an astonishing rate. Despite the wording of the Constitutionand laws on patents, the Patent Office is continuing to award patentson obvious ideas, trivial advances, and pure algorithms. In themiddle of 1995, they effectively granted patent protection to aprime number as well![8]</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[8] Patent 5,373,560 covering theuse of the prime number 98A3DF52 AEAE9799 325CB258 D767EBD1 F4630E9B9E21732A 4AFB1624 BA6DF911 466AD8DA 960586F4 A0D5E3C3 6AF09966 0BDDC1577E54A9F4 02334433 ACB14BCB was granted on December 13, 1994 to RogerSchlafly of California. Although the patent only covers the useof the number when used with Schalfly's algorithm, thereis no other practical use for this particular number, because itis easier (and more practical) to generate a &quot;random&quot;prime number than to use this one.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Thedanger comes when you write some new code that involves an algorithmyou read about, or simply developed based on obvious prior art.You may discover, when you try to use this in a wider market, thatlawyers from a large corporation will tell you that you cannot use&quot;their&quot; algorithm in your code because it is coveredby their patent. After a patent is granted, the patent holder controlsthe use of the patented item for 20 years from the date of filing&nbsp;- youaren't even supposed to use it for experimental purposeswithout their approval and/or license!</P><PCLASS="para">Manycompanies are now attempting to build up huge libraries of patentsto use as leverage in the marketplace. In effect, they are submittingapplications on everything they develop. This practice is sad,[9] becauseit will have an inhibitory effect on software development in theyears to come.

Unfortunately, we live in times in which there are people inpositions of political and legal influence who believe that theyshould be able to define what is and is not proper, and furthermorerestrict access to that material. This belief, coupled with thefact that U.S. standards of acceptability of nudity and erotic languageare more strict than in many places in the world, lead to conflicton the networks.</P><PCLASS="para">As this book goes to press, Congresshas passed a law that makes it a criminal offense to put &quot;indecent&quot;material on a computer where a minor might encounter it. We havealso heard of cases in which people have had their computers confiscatedfor having a computer image on disk, which they were unaware waspresent, that depicted activities that someone decided violated&quot;community standards.&quot; There have also been caseswhere individuals in one state have been convicted of pornographycharges in another state, even though the material was not consideredobscene in the state where the system was normally accessed. Andlast of all, you can be in serious legal trouble for simply <SPANCLASS="acronym">FTP</SPAN>ingan image of a naked minor, even if you don't know whatis in the image at the time you fetch it.</P><PCLASS="para">Many of theselaws are currently being applied selectively. In several cases,individuals have been arrested for downloading child pornographyfrom several major online service providers. In the United States,the mere possession of child pornography is a crime. Yet the onlineservice providers have not been harassed by law enforcement, eventhough the same child pornography resided on the online services'systems.</P><PCLASS="para">We won't comment on the nature ofthe laws involved, or the fanatic zeal with which some people pursueprosecution under these statutes.

In general, theU.S. Constitution protects most forms of expression as &quot;freespeech.&quot; However, prosecution may be threatened or attemptedsimply to intimidate and cause economic hardship: this is not prohibitedby the Constitution.</P><PCLASS="para">We should also point out that aspart of any sensible security administration, you should know whatyou have on your computer, and why.
