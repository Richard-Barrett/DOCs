People delete filesand alter system programs. People steal information. You shoulddetermine who you trust (and who you don't trust).</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-27-SECT-3.1">27.3.1 Your Employees?</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35930"></A>Much of this bookhas been devoted to techniques that protect computer systems fromattacks by outsiders. This focus isn't only our preoccupation:overwhelmingly, companies fear attacks from outsiders more thanthey fear attacks from the inside. Unfortunately, such fears aremisplaced. Statistics compiled by the <SPANCLASS="acronym">FBI</SPAN> andothers show that the majority of major economic losses from computercrime appear to involve people on the &quot;inside.&quot;</P><PCLASS="para">Companies seem to fear attacks from outsiders more than insidersbecause they fear the unknown. Few managers want to believe thattheir employees would betray their bosses, or the company as a whole.Few businesses want to believe that their executives would sellthemselves out to the competition. As a result, many organizationsspend vast sums protecting themselves from external threats, butdo little in the way of instituting controls and auditing to catchand prevent problems from the inside.</P><PCLASS="para">Not protecting your organization against its own employeesis a short-sighted policy. Protecting against insiders automaticallybuys an organization protection from outsiders as well. After all,what do outside attackers want most of all? They want an accounton your computer, an account from which they can unobtrusively investigateyour system and probe for vulnerabilities. Employes, executives,and other insiders already have this kind of access to your computers.And, according to recent computer industry surveys, attacks fromoutsiders and from rogue software account for only a small percentageof overall corporate losses; as many as 80% of attackscome from employees and former employees who are dishonest or disgruntled.</P><PCLASS="para">No person in your organization should be placed in a positionof absolute trust. Unfortunately, many organizations implicitlytrust the person who runs the firm's computer systems.Increasingly, outside auditors are now taking a careful look atthe policies and procedures in Information Systems support organizations&nbsp;- making certain that backups are being performed, that employeesare accountable for their actions, and that everybody operates withina framework of checks and balances.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-27-SECT-3.2">27.3.2 Your System Administrator?</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35940"></A>The threatof a dishonest system administrator should be obvious enough. Afterall, who knows better where all the goodies are kept, and whereall the alarms are set? However, before you say that you trust yoursupport staff, ask yourself a question: they may be honest, butare they competent?</P><PCLASS="para">We know of a recent case in which a departmental server wasthoroughly compromised by at least two different groups of hackers.The system administrator had no idea what had happened, probablybecause he wasn't very adept at <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>system administration. How were the intruders eventually discovered?During a software audit, the system was revealed to be running softwarethat was inconsistent with what should have been there. What shouldhave been there was an old, unpatched version of the software.[5] Investigation revealedthat hackers had apparently installed new versions of system commandsto keep their environment up to date because the legitimate administratorwasn't doing the job.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[5] Actually, the very latest software <EMCLASS="emphasis">should</EM>have been there. However, the system administrator hadn'tdone any updates in more than two years, so we expected the oldsoftware to be in place.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Essentially, the hackers were doing a better job of maintainingthe machine than the hired staff was. The hackers were then usingthe machine to stage attacks against other computers on the Internet.</P><PCLASS="para">In such cases, you probably have more to fear from incompetentstaff than from some outsiders. After all, if the staff bunglesthe backups, reformats the disk drives, and then accidentally erasesover the only good copies of data you have left, the data is aseffectively destroyed as if a professional saboteur had hacked intothe system and deleted it.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-27-SECT-3.3">27.3.3 Your Vendor?</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35953"></A>We heard about one case in whicha field service technician for a major computer company was busycasing sites for later burglaries. He was shown into the building,was given unsupervised access to the equipment rooms, and was ableto obtain alarm codes and door-lock combinations over time. Whenthe thefts occurred, police were sure the crime was an inside job,but no one immediately realized how &quot;inside&quot; thetechnician had become.</P><PCLASS="para">There are cases in which U.S. military and diplomatic personnelat overseas postings had computer problems and took their machinesin to local service centers. When they got home, technicians discovereda wide variety of interesting&nbsp;- and unauthorized&nbsp;- additionsto the circuitry.</P><PCLASS="para">What about the software you get from the vendor? For instance,AT&amp;T claims that Ken Thompson's compiler modifications(described earlier under &quot;Trusting Trust&quot;) werenever in any code that was shipped to customers. How do we knowfor sure? What's really in the code on <EMCLASS="emphasis">your</EM>machines?</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-27-SECT-3.4">27.3.4 Your Consultants?</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35961"></A>There are currently severalpeople in the field of computer security consulting whose past isnot quite sterling. These are people who have led major hackingrings, who brag about breaking into corporate and government computers,and who may have been indicted and prosecuted for computer crimes.Some of them have even done time in jail. Now they do security consulting&nbsp;- anda few even use their past in advertising (although most do not).</P><PCLASS="para">How trustworthy are these people? Who better to break intoyour computer system later on than the person who helped designthe defenses? Think about this issue from a liability standpoint&nbsp;- wouldyou hire a confessed arsonist to install your fire alarm system,or a convicted pedophile to run your company day-care center? He'dcertainly know what to protect the children against! What wouldyour insurance company have to say about that? Your stockholders?</P><PCLASS="para">Some security consultants are more than simply criminals;they are compulsive system hackers. Why should you believe thatthey are more trustworthy and have more self control now than theydid a few years ago?</P><PCLASS="para">If you are careful not to hire suspicious individuals, howabout your service provider? Your maintenance organization? Yoursoftware vendor? The company hired to clean your offices at night?The temp service that provides you with replacements for your secretarywhen your secretary goes on leave? Potential computer criminals,and those with an unsavory past, are as capable of putting on streetclothes and holding down a regular job as anyone else. They don'thave a scarlet &quot;H&quot; tattooed on their foreheads.</P><PCLASS="para">Can you trust references for your hires or consultants? Considerthe story, possibly apocryphal, of the consultant at the large bankwho found a way to crack security and steal $5 million.He was caught by bank security personnel later, but they couldn'ttrace the money or discover how he did it. So he struck a deal withthe bank: he'd return all but 10% of the money,forever remain silent about the theft, and reveal the flaw he exploitedin return for no prosecution and a favorable letter of reference.The bank eagerly agreed, and wrote the loss off as an advertisingand training expense. Of course, with the favorable letter, he quicklygot a job at the next bank running the same software. After onlya few such job changes, he was able to retire with a hefty savingsaccount in Switzerland.</P><DIVCLASS="sidebar"><H4CLASS="sidebar"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-35967">Bankers Mistrust</A></H4><PCLASS="para">Banks and financial institutions have notorious reputationsfor not reporting computer crimes. We have heard of cases in whichbank personnel have traced active hacking attempts to a specificperson, or developed evidence showing that someone had penetratedtheir systems, but they did not report these cases to the policefor fear of the resulting publicity.</P><PCLASS="para">In other cases, we've heard that bank personnel havepaid people off to get them to stop their attacks and keep quiet.Some experts in the industry contend that major banks and tradinghouses are willing to tolerate a few million dollars in losses perweek rather than suffer the perceived bad publicity about a computertheft. To them, a few million a week is less than the interest theymake on investments over a few hours: it's below the noisethreshold.</P><PCLASS="para">Are these stories true? We don't know, but we haven'tseen too many cases of banks reporting computer crimes, and we somehowdon't think they are immune to attack. If anything, they'rebigger targets. However, we do know that bankers tend to be conservative,and they worry that publicity about computer problems is bad forbusiness.</P><PCLASS="para">Odd, if true. Think about the fact that when some kid witha gun steals $1000 from the tellers at a branch office,the crime makes the evening news, pictures are in the newspaper,and a regional alert is issued. No one loses confidence in the bank.But if some hacker steals $5 million as the result of abug in the software and a lack of ethics...</P><PCLASS="para">Who do you entrust with <EMCLASS="emphasis">your</EM> life'ssavings?</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-27-SECT-3.5">27.3.5 Response Personnel?</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35978"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35980"></A>Your system has been hacked. You have a littleinformation, but not much. If someone acts quickly, before logsat remote machines are erased, you might be able to identify theculprit. You get a phone call from someone claiming to be with the<SPANCLASS="acronym">CERT</SPAN>-CC, or maybe the <SPANCLASS="acronym">FBI</SPAN>.They tell you they learned from the administrator at another sitethat your systems might have been hacked. They tell you what tolook for, then ask what you found on your own. They promise to followright up on the leads you have and ask you to remain silent so asnot to let on to the hackers that someone is hot on their trail.You never hear back from them, and later inquiries reveal that noone from the agency involved ever called you.</P><PCLASS="para">Does this case sound farfetched? It shouldn't. Administratorsat commercial sites, government sites, and even response teams haveall received telephone calls from people who claim to be representativesof various agencies but who aren't. We've alsoheard that some of these same people have had their email intercepted,copied, and read on its way to their machines (usually, a hackedservice provider or altered <SPANCLASS="acronym">DNS</SPAN> record is allthat is needed). The result? The social engineers working the phoneshave some additional background information that makes them soundall the more official.</P><PCLASS="para">Who do you trust on the telephone when you get a call? Why?</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch27_02.htm"TITLE="27.2 Can You Trust Your Suppliers?"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 27.2 Can You Trust Your Suppliers?"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch27_04.htm"TITLE="27.4 What All This Means"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 27.4 What All This Means"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">27.2 Can You Trust Your Suppliers?</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">27.4 What All This Means</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
