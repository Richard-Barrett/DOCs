Instead, we want to getacross the point that you need to consider carefully who and whatyou trust. If you have information or equipment that is of valueto you, you need to think about the risks and dangers that mightbe out there. To have security means to trust, but that trust mustbe well placed.</P><PCLASS="para">If you are protecting information that is worth a great deal,attackers may well be willing to invest significant time and resourcesto break your security. You may also think you don't haveinformation that is worth a great deal; nevertheless, you are atarget anyway. Why? Your site may be a convenient stepping stoneto another, more valuable site. Or perhaps one of your users isstoring information of great value that you don't knowabout. Or maybe you simply don't realize how much the informationyou have is actually worth. For instance, in the late 1980's,Soviet agents were willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollarsfor copies of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">VMS</SPAN> operating system source&nbsp;- thesame source that many site administrators kept in unlocked cabinetsin public computer rooms.</P><PCLASS="para">To trust, you need to be suspicious. Ask questions. Do backgroundchecks. Test code. Get written assurances. Don't allowdisclaimers. Harbor a healthy suspicion of fortuitous coincidences(the <SPANCLASS="acronym">FBI</SPAN> happening to call or that patch tapeshowing up by FedEx, hours after you discover someone trying toexploit a bug that the patch purports to fix). You don'tneed to go overboard, butremember that the best way to develop trustis to anticipate problems and attacks, and then test for them. Thentest again, later. Don't let a routine convince you thatno problems will occur.</P><PCLASS="para">If you absorb everything we've written in this book,and apply it, you'll be way ahead of the game. However,this information is only the first part of a comprehensive securityplan. You need to constantly be accumulating new information, studyingyour risks, and planning for the future. Complacency is one of thebiggest dangers you can face. As we said at the beginning of thebook, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> can be a secure system, but only ifyou understand it and deploy it in a monitored environment.</P><PCLASS="para">You can trust us on that.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35997"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch27_03.htm"TITLE="27.3 Can You Trust People?"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 27.3 Can You Trust People?"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="PART"HREF="part07.htm"TITLE="VII.
