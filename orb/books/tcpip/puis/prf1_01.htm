Today, more than 10 million Americansuse the Internet on a regular basis to send electronic mail, cruisethe World Wide Web, and even shop. In 1991, we called the Interneta &quot;global village.&quot; Today, it is an Information Highway that's gettinglarger and more crowded by the minute, with millions of users fromhundreds of countries on all seven continents electronically connectedto each other.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-41"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-43"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-46"></A></P><PCLASS="para">And yet, despite our greaterreliance on network computing, the Internet isn't a safer placetoday than it was in 1991. If anything, the Internet is quicklybecoming the Wild West of cyberspace. Although academics and industryleaders have long known about fundamental vulnerabilities of computersconnected to the Internet, these flaws have been accommodated rather thancorrected. As a result, we have seen many cases within the pastfew years of wide-scale security infractions throughout the network;in one single case, more than 30,000 people had their passwordsstolen and accounts compromised; in another, more than 20,000 creditcard numbers were allegedly stolen from one company in a singleunauthorized access.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-51"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-54"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-57"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-61"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-64"></A></P><PCLASS="para">Computer crime is agrowing problem.

The survey also found that morethan 80% had a full-time information security director, and nearly70% thought that the computer security threat to companies had increasedwithin the past five years. </P><PCLASS="para">What do all of these numbers meanfor <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>? Because of the widespread use of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> asthe operating system of choice on the Internet, and its prevalencein client/server environments, it is undoubtedly the case that many <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> machines were involved in these incidents.Because of its continuing use in these environments, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> maybe involved in the majority of incidents yet to come-the statisticsand trends are disturbing. We hope that this new edition of ourbook helps limit the scope and number of these new incidents.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-PREFACE-SECT-1">UNIX &quot;Security&quot;?</A></H2><PCLASS="para">When the first versionof this book appeared in 1991, many people thought that the words&quot;<SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> security&quot; were an oxymoron-two words thatappeared to contradict each other, much like the words &quot;jumbo shrimp&quot;or &quot;Congressional action.&quot; After all, the ease with which a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> gurucould break into a system, seize control, and wreak havoc was legendaryin the computer community. Some people couldn't even imagine thata computer running <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> could be made secure. </P><PCLASS="para">Since then, the whole world of computers has changed. Thesedays, many people regard <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> as a relativelysecure operating system...at least, they use <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> asif it were. Today, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> is used by millions ofpeople and many thousands of organizations around the world, allwithout obvious major mishap. And while <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> wasnot designed with military-level security in mind, it was builtboth to withstand limited external attacks and to protect usersfrom the accidental or malicious actions of other users on the system.Years of constant use and study have made the operating system evenmore secure, because most of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> securityfaults are publicized and fixed.</P><PCLASS="para">But the truth is, <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> really hasn't become significantly moresecure with its increase in popularity. That's because fundamentalflaws still remain in the interaction of the operating system's designand its uses. The <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> superuser remains a singlepoint of attack: any intruder or insider who can become the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> superusercan take over the system, booby-trap its programs, and hold thecomputer's users hostage-sometimes even without their knowledge.</P><PCLASS="para">One thing that has improved is our understanding of how tokeep a computer relatively secure. In recent years, a wide varietyof tools and techniques have been developed with the single goalof helping system administrators secure their <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> computers.Another thing that's changed is the level of understanding of <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> bysystem administrators: now it is relatively easy for companies andother organizations to hire a professional system manager who willbe concerned about computer security and make it a top priority.</P><PCLASS="para">This book can help. </P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="PUIS-CHP-PREFACE-SECT-1.1">What This Book Is</A></H3><PCLASS="para">This book is a <EMCLASS="emphasis">practical</EM> guideto <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> security. For users, we explain what computersecurity is, describe some of the dangers that you may face, andtell you how to keep your data safe and sound. For administrators,we explain in greater detail how <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> securitymechanisms work and tell how to configure and administer your computerfor maximum protection. For everybody, we try to teach somethingabout <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>'s internals, its history, and howto keep yourself from getting burned.</P><PCLASS="para">Is this book foryou? Probably. If you administer a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> system,you will find many tips for running your computer more securely. Evenif you're a casual user of a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> system, youshould read this book. If you are a complete novice at <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>,you will benefit from reading this book, because it contains a thoroughoverview of the <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> operating system in general.You don't want to stay a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> novice forever!(But you might want to read some other O'Reilly books first; consult <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appd_01.htm"TITLE="Paper Sources">Appendix D, <CITECLASS="appendix">Paper Sources</CITE></A>, for some suggestions.)</P><PCLASS="para">What we'vedone here has been to collect helpful information concerning howto secure your <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> system against threats, both internaland external. Most of the material is intended for a <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> systemadministrator or manager. In most cases, we've presented materialand commands without explaining in any detail how they work, andin several cases we've simply pointed out the nature of the commandsand files that need to be examined; we've assumed that a typicalsystem administrator is familiar with the commands and files ofhis or her system, or at least has the manuals available to study.</P><DIVCLASS="sidebar"><H4CLASS="sidebar"><ACLASS="title"NAME="AUTOID-165">A Note About Your Manuals</A></H4><PCLASS="para">Some people may think that it is a cop-out for a book on computersecurity to advise the reader to read his or her system manuals.But it's not. The fact is, computer vendors change their softwaremuch faster (and with less notice) than publishers bring out new editionsof books. If you are concerned about running <EMCLASS="emphasis">your</EM> computersecurely, then you should spend the extra time to read your manualsto verify what we say. You should also experiment with your runningsystem, to make sure that the programs behave the way they are documented.</P><PCLASS="para">Thus, we recommend that you go back and read through the manualsevery few months to stay familiar with your system. Sometimes rereadingthe manuals after gaining new experience gives you added insight.Other times it reminds you of useful features that you aren't yetusing. Many successful system administrators have told us that theymake it a point to reread all their manuals every 6 to 12 months!</P></DIV><PCLASS="para">Certain key parts of this book were written in greater detailthan the rest, with a novice user in mind. We have done this fortwo reasons: to be sure that important <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN> securityconcepts are presented to the fullest and to make important sections(such as the ones on file permissions and passwords) readable ontheir own. That way, this book can be passed around with a notesaying, &quot;Read <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch03_01.htm"TITLE="Users and Passwords">Chapter 3, <CITECLASS="chapter">Users and Passwords</CITE></A> to learn about how to set passwords.&quot;[4] </P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[4] Remember to pass around the book itself or get anothercopy to share.

Neither is thisbook a system administration tutorial-there are better books forthat,[5] and good system administrators need to know about much more thansecurity.

Thus,this is not a book that is likely to help you design new securitymechanisms for <SPANCLASS="acronym">UNIX</SPAN>, although we have includeda chapter on how to write more secure programs. </P><PCLASS="para">We'vealso tried to minimize the amount of information in this book thatwould be useful to people trying to break into computer systems.If that is your goal, then this book probably isn't for you. </P><PCLASS="para">We have also tried to resist the temptation to suggest:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Replacements for your standard commands</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Modifications to your kernel</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Other significant programming exercises to protectyour system</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">The reason hasto do with our definition of <EMCLASS="emphasis">practical</EM>. Forsecurity measures to be effective, they need to be generally applicable.Most users of commercial systems do not have access to the sourcecode, and many don't even have access to compilers for their systems.Public domain sources for some replacement commands are unlikelyto have support for the special features different vendors add totheir systems. If we were to suggest changes, they might not beapplicable to every platform of interest. </P><PCLASS="para">There isalso a problem associated with managing wide-scale changes. Notonly may changes make the system more difficult to maintain, butchanges may be impossible to manage across dozens of architecturesin different locations and configurations. They also will make vendormaintenance more difficult-how can vendors respond to bug reportsfor software that they didn't provide?</P><PCLASS="para">Last of all,we have seen many programs and suggested fixes posted on the Internetthat are incorrect or even dangerous. Many administrators of commercialand academic systems do not have the necessary expertise to evaluatethe overall security impact of changes to their system's kernel,architecture, or commands. If you routinely download and installthird-party patches and programs to improve your system's security,your overall security may well be worse in the long term.</P><PCLASS="para">For allof these reasons, our emphasis is on using tools provided with youroperating systems. Where there are exceptions to this rule, we willexplain our reasoning.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">&nbsp;</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf1_02.htm"TITLE="Scope of This Book"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: Scope of This Book"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">&nbsp;</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">Scope of This Book</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
