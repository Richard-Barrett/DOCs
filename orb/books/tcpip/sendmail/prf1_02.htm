The <EMCLASS="emphasis">delivermail</EM> programwas shipped in 1979 with 4.0 and 4.1 BSD UNIX. Unfortunately, <EMCLASS="emphasis">delivermail</EM>was not flexible enough to handle the changes in mail routingrequirements that actually occurred. Perhaps its greatest weaknesswas that its configuration was compiled-in.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-59"></A>In 1980, ARPAnet began converting from NCP (Network ControlProtocol) to TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). This changeincreased the number of possible hosts from 256 to over one billion.Another change converted from a &quot;flat&quot; host-name space (likeMIT-XX) into a hierarchical name space (likeXX.MIT.EDU). Prior to these changes, mail was transportedusing the <EMCLASS="emphasis">ftp</EM> protocol (File Transfer Protocol). Afterward,a new protocol was developed for transporting mail called SMTP (Simple MailTransfer Protocol). These developments were not instantaneous.Some networks continued to run NCP years after most othersswitched to TCP. SMTP itself underwent many revisions beforefinally settling into its present form.</P><PCLASS="para">Responding to these and other changes, Eric evolved <EMCLASS="emphasis">delivermail</EM>into <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>.To ensure that messages transferredbetween networks would obey the conventions required by thosenetworks,Eric took a &quot;liberal&quot; approach&nbsp;- modifying address information toconform, rather than rejecting it. At the time, for example,UUCP mail often had no headers at all, so <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>had to create them from scratch.</P><PCLASS="para">The first <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM> program was shipped with 4.1c BSD(the first version of Berkeley UNIX to include TCP/IP).From that first release to the present,[1]Eric has continued toenhance <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>, first at UC Berkeley, then at Britton Lee, then backat UC Berkeley, and now with InReference Inc. The current version of <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM> is 8.x (orV8 for short). V8 is a major rewrite that includes many bugfixes and significant enhancements.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] With one long gap between 1982 and 1990.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">But Eric wasn't the only one working on <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>. In 1987, Lennart Lovstrand of the University of Link&ouml;ping, Sweden,developed the IDA enhancements to BSD <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM> Version 5.IDA (which stands for &quot;Institutionen f&ouml;r Datavetenskap&quot;)injected a number of improvementsinto <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM> (such as support for <EMCLASS="emphasis">dbm</EM> files and separate rewritingof headers and envelopes) and fixed a number of bugs. As the '90sapproached, two offspring of IDA appeared.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-78"></A>Neil Rickert (Northern Illinois University) and Paul Pomes (The University of Illinois) took over maintenance of IDA <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>.With contributions from around the world, theirversion (UIUC IDA) represents a continuation ofthe work begun by Lennart Lovstrand.Neil focused on fixing and enhancing the configuration filesinto their current <EMCLASS="emphasis">m4</EM>-based form. Paulmaintained thecode, continually adding enhancements and fixing bugs. In general,their version was large, ambitious, and highly portable. It succeededin solving many complex mail routing problems.</P><PCLASS="para">A variation on IDA <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM> was also developed by Paul Vixie(while at Digital Equipment Corporation).Called KJS (for King James <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>), it was a more conservativeoutgrowth of Lennart Lovstrand's last IDA release. The focus of KJSwas on code improvement rather than changes to configuration files.</P><PCLASS="para">In addition to these major offshoots, many vendors have modified<EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM> to suit their particular needs.Sun Microsystems made many modifications and enhancements to<EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>, including support for <EMCLASS="emphasis">nis</EM> and <EMCLASS="emphasis">nisplus</EM> maps.Hewlett Packard also contributed many fine enhancements including8BITMIME support.</P><PCLASS="para">This explosion of <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM> versions has led to a greatdeal of confusion. Solutions to problems that work for one versionof <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM> fail miserably with others. Beyond this,configuration files are not portable, and some features cannot be shared.</P><PCLASS="para">In 1994, Eric began work on V8.7 <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>. The first major departure from tradition in years, V8.7introduces multicharacter option and macro names,new interactive commands to use with -bt mode, and fixes many of the problemsand limitations of earlier releases.But, more important, V8.7 has officially adopted most of the good featuresfrom IDA, KJS, Sun, and HP's <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>, and kept abreast ofthe latest standards from the Internet Engineering Task Force.In 1996, Eric began work on V8.8 <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>. This release continued the trendbegun with V8.7, adding many requested new features and options, and tightening security.Since V8.8 is now the official release of<EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>, it is the one solely documented in this book.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-98"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-99"></A>&#13;</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf1_01.htm"TITLE="Preface"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: Preface"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="sendmail"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="sendmail"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf1_03.htm"TITLE="Eric Allman Speaks"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: Eric Allman Speaks"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">Preface</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">Eric Allman Speaks</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
