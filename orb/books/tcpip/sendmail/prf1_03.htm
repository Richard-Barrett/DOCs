I think there are three reasons.</P><PCLASS="para">First, <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM> took the approach that it should try to accept,clean up, and deliver even very &quot;crufty&quot; messages instead ofrejecting them because they didn't meet some protocol.  I feltthis was important because I was trying to gateway UUCP to theARPAnet.  At the time, the ARPAnet was small, UUCP was anarchy(some say it still is), and UNIX mail programs generally didn't evenunderstand headers.  It was harder to do, but after all, the goal wasto communicate, not to be pedantic.</P><PCLASS="para">Second, I limited myself to the routing function&nbsp;- I wouldn'twrite user agents or delivery back-ends.  This was a departurefrom the dominant thought of the time, where routing logic, localdelivery, and often the network code was incorporated directlyinto the user agents.  But it did let people incorporate theirnew networks quickly.</P><PCLASS="para">Third, the <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM> configuration file was flexible enough toadapt to a rapidly changing world:  The 1980s saw the proliferation of new protocols,networks, and user agents.</P><PCLASS="para">And, of course, it didn't hurt that it was free, available atthe right time, and did what needed to be done.</P><PCLASS="para">Configuring <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM> is complex because the world is complex.It is dynamic because the world is dynamic.Someday <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>, like X11, will die&nbsp;- but I'm not holding mybreath.  In the meantime, perhaps this book will help.</P><PCLASS="para">When I started reviewing Bryan's manuscript, I had been avoidingany major work on <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM>.  But then I started readingabout various petty bugs and annoyances that all seemed easy tofix.  So I started making small fixes, then larger ones; thenI went through RFC1123 to bring the specs up-to-date, cleanedup a bunch of eight-bit problems, and added ESMTP.  It would befair to say that the book and <EMCLASS="emphasis">sendmail</EM> Version 8 fed on eachother&nbsp;- each has improved the presence of the other.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-118"></A>&#13;</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf1_02.htm"TITLE="History"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: History"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="sendmail"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="sendmail"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf1_04.htm"TITLE="The Future"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: The Future"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">History</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">The Future</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="../tcpip/index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
