Not so with networkadministration. Once you place your computer on a network, it interactswith many other systems. The way you do network administration taskshas effects, good and bad, not only on your system but on other systemson the network. A sound understanding of basic network administrationbenefits everyone.</P><PCLASS="para">Networking computers dramatically enhances their ability to communicate&nbsp;- and most computers are used more for communication than computation. Many mainframes and supercomputers are busy crunching the numbers forbusiness and science, but the number of such systems pales in comparisonto the millions of systems busy moving mail to a remote colleague orretrieving information from a remote repository. Further, when you thinkof the hundreds of millions of desktop systems that are used primarily for preparing documents to communicate ideas from one person to another, itis easy to see why most computers can be viewed as communications devices.</P><PCLASS="para">The positive impact of computer communications increases with the numberand type of computers that participate in the network. One of the great<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-226"></A>benefits of TCP/IP is that it provides interoperable communicationsbetween all types of hardware and all kinds of operating systems.</P><PCLASS="para">This book is a practical, step-by-step guide to configuring andmanaging TCP/IP networking software on UNIX computer systems. TCP/IPis the software package that dominates UNIX data<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-230"></A>communications. It is theleading communications software for UNIX local area networks and enterpriseintranets, and for the foundation of the worldwide Internet.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-233"></A>The name &quot;TCP/IP&quot; refers to an entire suite of data communicationsprotocols. The suite gets its name from two of the protocols thatbelong to it: the Transmission Control Protocol and the InternetProtocol. Although there are many other protocols in the suite,  TCP and IP are certainly two of the mostimportant.</P><PCLASS="para">The first part of this book discusses the basics of TCP/IP and how itmoves data across a network. The second part explains how to configureand run TCP/IP on a UNIX system. Let's start with a little history.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="TCP2-CH-1-SECT-1">1.1 TCP/IP and the Internet</A></H2><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="TCP2-CH-1-IX-TCP-IP-PROTOCOL-HISTORY-OF"></A>In 1969 the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) funded aresearch and development project to create an experimental packet-switching network. This network, called the <EMCLASS="emphasis">ARPANET</EM>, was builtto study techniques for providing robust, reliable, vendor-independentdata communications. Many techniques of modern data communicationswere developed in the ARPANET.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="TCP2-CH-1-IX-INTERNET-MILITARY-ORIGINS-OF"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="TCP2-CH-1-IX-ARPANET"></A>The experimental ARPANET was so successful that many of theorganizations attached to it began to use it for daily datacommunications. In 1975 the ARPANET was converted from an experimentalnetwork to an operational network, and the responsibility foradministering the network was given to the Defense Communications<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-250"></A>Agency (DCA).[1]However, development of the ARPANET did not stop justbecause it was being used as an operational network; the basic TCP/IPprotocols were developed after the ARPANET was operational.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] DCA has since changed its name to Defense Information Systems Agency(DISA).</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">The TCP/IP protocols were adopted as Military Standards (MIL STD) in1983, and all hosts connected to the network were required to convertto the new protocols. To ease this conversion, DARPA[2]funded Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN) to implement TCP/IP in Berkeley (BSD) UNIX.Thus began the marriage of UNIX and TCP/IP.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[2] During the 1980s and early 1990s, ARPA, which is part of the U.S. Department of Defense, was named Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA). Currently known as ARPA, the agency is again preparing to changeits name to DARPA. Whether it is known as ARPA or DARPA, the agency andits mission of funding advanced research has remained the same.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">About the time that TCP/IP was adopted as a standard, the term <EMCLASS="emphasis">Internet</EM>came into common usage. In 1983, the old ARPANET was divided intoMILNET, the unclassified part of the Defense Data Network (DDN), and anew, smaller ARPANET. &quot;Internet&quot; was used to refer to the entirenetwork: MILNET plus ARPANET.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-259"></A></P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-261"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-263"></A>In 1985 the National Science Foundation (NSF) created NSFNet and<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-265"></A>connected it to the then-existing Internet. The original NSFNet linkedtogether the five NSF supercomputer centers. It was smaller than theARPANET and no faster&nbsp;- 56Kbps. Nonetheless, the creation of theNSFNet was a significant event in the history of the Internet becauseNSF brought with it a new vision of the use of the Internet. NSFwanted to extend the network to every scientist and engineer in theUnited States. To accomplish this, in 1987 NSF created a new, faster backboneand a three-tiered network topology that included thebackbone, regional networks, and local networks.</P><PCLASS="para">In 1990, the ARPANET formally passed out of existence, and the NSFNetceased its role as a primary Internet backbone network in 1995. Still,today the Internet is larger than ever and encompasses more than 95,000networks worldwide. This network of networks is linked togetherin the United States at several major interconnection points:<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-268"></A></P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-272"></A>The three Network Access Points (NAPs) created by the NSF to ensurecontinued broad-based access to the Internet.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-276"></A>The Federal Information Exchanges (FIXs) interconnect U.S.government networks.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-280"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-282"></A>The Commercial Information Exchange (CIX) was the firstinterconnect specifically for commercial Internet Service Providers(ISPs).</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-286"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-288"></A>The Metropolitan Area Exchanges (MAEs) were also created tointerconnect commercial ISPs.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="TCP2-CH-1-IX-INTERNET-RAPID-GROWTH-OF"></A>The Internet has grown far beyond its original scope. The originalnetworks and agencies that built the Internet no longer play anessential role for the current network. The Internet has evolved froma simple backbone network, through a three-tiered hierarchicalstructure, to a huge network of interconnected, distributed networkhubs. It has grown exponentially since 1983&nbsp;- doubling insize every year. Through all of this incredible change one thing hasremained constant: the Internet is built on the TCP/IP protocolsuite.</P><PCLASS="para">A sign of the network's success is the confusion thatsurrounds the term <EMCLASS="emphasis">internet</EM>. Originally it was usedonly as the name of the network built upon the Internet Protocol. Now<EMCLASS="emphasis">internet</EM> is a generic term used to refer to an entire classof networks. An internet (lowercase &quot;i&quot;) is any collectionof separate physical networks, interconnected by a common protocol, toform a single logical network. The Internet (uppercase &quot;I&quot;)is the worldwide collection of interconnected networks, which grew outof the original ARPANET,  that uses <EMCLASS="emphasis">Internet Protocol</EM> (IP) tolink the various physical networks into a single logical network. Inthis book, both &quot;internet&quot; and &quot;Internet&quot; refer tonetworks that are interconnected by TCP/IP.</P><PCLASS="para">Because TCP/IP is required for Internet connection, the growth of theInternet has spurred interest in TCP/IP. As more organizations becomefamiliar with TCP/IP, they see that its power can be applied in othernetwork applications. The Internet protocols are often used for localarea networking, even when the local network is not connected to theInternet. TCP/IP is also widely used to build enterprise networks.TCP/IP-based enterprise networks that use Internet techniques andWorld Wide Web tools to disseminate internal corporateinformation are called <EMCLASS="emphasis">intranets</EM>.  TCP/IP is the foundation of allof these varied networks.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-300"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-301"></A></P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="TCP2-CH-1-SECT-1.1">1.1.1 TCP/IP Features</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-305"></A>The popularity of the TCP/IP protocols did not grow rapidly justbecause the protocols were there, or because connecting to the Internetmandated their use. They met an important need (worldwide datacommunication) at the right time, and they had several importantfeatures that allowed them to meet this need. These features are:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Open protocol standards, freely available and developed independentlyfrom any specific computer hardware or operating system.

In international relations,protocols minimize the problems caused by cultural differences whenvarious nations work together. By agreeing to a common set of rulesthat are widely known and independent of any nation's customs,diplomatic protocols minimize misunderstandings; everyone knows how toact and how to interpret the actions of others.  Similarly, whencomputers communicate, it is necessary to define a set of rules togovern their communications.</P><PCLASS="para">In data communications these sets of rules are also called<EMCLASS="emphasis">protocols</EM>. In homogeneous networks, a single computer vendorspecifies a set of communications rules designed to use the strengths of the vendor's operating system and hardwarearchitecture. But homogeneous networks are like the culture of asingle country&nbsp;- only the natives are truly at home in it. TCP/IPattempts to create a heterogeneous network<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-331"></A>with open protocols that are independent of operating system and architectural differences.TCP/IP protocols are available to everyone, and are developed andchanged by consensus&nbsp;- not by the fiat of one manufacturer. Everyoneis free to develop products to meet these open protocolspecifications.</P><PCLASS="para">The open nature of TCP/IP protocols requirespublicly available standards documents. All protocols inthe TCP/IP protocol suite are defined in one of three Internetstandards publications. A number of the protocols have been adopted as<EMCLASS="emphasis">Military Standards</EM> (MIL STD). Others were published as<EMCLASS="emphasis">Internet Engineering Notes</EM> (IEN)&nbsp;- though the IEN form ofpublication has now been abandoned. But most information about TCP/IPprotocols is published as <EMCLASS="emphasis">Requests for Comments</EM> (RFCs).<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-338"></A>RFCs contain the latest versions of the specifications of all standardTCP/IP protocols.[3]As the title &quot;Request for Comments&quot; implies, thestyle and content of these documents is much less rigid than moststandards documents.
