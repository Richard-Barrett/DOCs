Even other computerprofessionals may not be familiar with all the terms in thenetworking alphabet soup. As is always the case, English andcomputer-speak are not equivalent (or even necessarily compatible)languages. Although descriptions and examples<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-350"></A>should make the meaningof the networking jargon more apparent, sometimes terms are ambiguous.A common frame of reference is necessary for understanding datacommunications terminology.</P><PCLASS="para">An architectural model developed by the International Standards<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-353"></A>Organization (ISO) is frequently used to describe the structure andfunction of data communications protocols.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="TCP2-CH-1-IX-OPEN-SYSTEMS-INTERCONNECT-OSI-REFERENCE-MODEL"></A>This architectural model,which is called the <EMCLASS="emphasis">Open Systems Interconnect Reference Model</EM> (OSI),provides a common reference for discussing communications. The termsdefined by this model are well understood and widely used in the datacommunications community&nbsp;- so widely used, in fact, that it is difficultto discuss data communications without using OSI's terminology.</P><PCLASS="para">The OSI Reference Model contains seven <EMCLASS="emphasis">layers</EM><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-360"></A>that define thefunctions of data communications protocols. Each layer of the OSI modelrepresents a function performed when data is transferred betweencooperating applications across an intervening network.<ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch01_02.htm#TCP2-CH-1-FIG-0"TITLE="The OSI Reference Model">Figure 1.1</A>identifies each layer by name and provides a short functionaldescription for it. Looking at this figure, the protocols are like apile of building blocks stacked one upon another. Because of thisappearance, the structure is often called a <EMCLASS="emphasis">stack</EM><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-364"></A>or <EMCLASS="emphasis">protocol stack</EM>.</P><H4CLASS="figure"><ACLASS="title"NAME="TCP2-CH-1-FIG-0">Figure 1.1: The OSI Reference Model</A></H4><IMGCLASS="graphic"SRC="figs/tcp2_0101.gif"ALT="Figure 1.1"><PCLASS="para">A layer does not define a single protocol&nbsp;- it defines a datacommunications function that may be performed by any number ofprotocols. Therefore, each layer may contain multiple protocols, eachproviding a service suitable to the function of that layer. Forexample, a file transfer protocol and an electronic mail protocol bothprovide user services, and both are part of the Application Layer.</P><PCLASS="para">Every protocol communicates with its peer. A <EMCLASS="emphasis">peer</EM> is animplementation of the same protocol in the equivalent layer on a remotesystem; i.e., the local file transfer protocol is the peer of a remotefile transfer protocol. Peer-level communications<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-374"></A>must be standardizedfor successful communications to take place. In the abstract, eachprotocol is concerned only with communicating to its peer; it does notcare about the layer above or below it.</P><PCLASS="para">However, there must also be agreement on how to pass data between thelayers on a single computer, because every layer is involved in sendingdata from a local application to an equivalent remote application. Theupper layers rely on the lower layersto transfer the data over the underlying network. Data is passed downthe stack from one layer to the next, until it is transmitted over thenetwork by the Physical Layer protocols. At the remote end, the data ispassed up the stack to the receiving application. The individual layersdo not need to know how the layers above and below them function; theyonly need to know how to pass data to them. Isolating networkcommunications functions in different layers minimizes the impact oftechnological change on the entire protocol<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-378"></A>suite. New applications canbe added without changing the physical network, and new network hardwarecan be installed without rewriting the application software.</P><PCLASS="para">Although the OSI model is useful, the TCP/IP protocols don'tmatch its structure exactly.  Therefore, in our discussions of TCP/IP, we usethe layers of the OSI model in the following way:</P><DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Application&nbsp;Layer</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-388"></A>The Application Layer is the level of the protocol hierarchy whereuser-accessed network processes reside. In this text, a TCP/IPapplication is any network process that occurs above the TransportLayer. This includes all of the processes that users directly interactwith, as well as other processes at this level that users are notnecessarily aware of.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Presentation&nbsp;Layer</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-395"></A>For cooperating applications to exchange data, they must agree abouthow data is represented. In OSI, this layer provides standard datapresentation routines. This function is frequently handled within theapplications in TCP/IP, though increasingly TCP/IP protocols such as<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-397"></A>XDR and MIME<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-399"></A>perform this function.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Session&nbsp;Layer</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-406"></A>As with the Presentation Layer, the Session Layer is not identifiableas a separate layer in the TCP/IP protocol hierarchy. The OSI SessionLayer manages the sessions (connection) between cooperatingapplications. In TCP/IP, this function largely occurs in the TransportLayer, and the term &quot;session&quot; is not used. For TCP/IP, the terms<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-408"></A>&quot;socket&quot; and &quot;port&quot;<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-410"></A>are used to describe the path over whichcooperating applications communicate.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Transport&nbsp;Layer</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-417"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-419"></A>Much of our discussion of TCP/IP is directed to the protocols thatoccur in the Transport Layer. The Transport Layer in the OSI referencemodel guarantees thatthe receiver gets the data exactly as it was sent. In TCP/IP thisfunction is performed by the <EMCLASS="emphasis">Transmission Control Protocol</EM>(TCP). However, TCP/IP offers a second Transport Layer service,<EMCLASS="emphasis">User Datagram Protocol</EM> (UDP),<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-424"></A>that does not perform theend-to-end reliability checks.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Network&nbsp;Layer</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-431"></A>The Network Layer manages connections across the network and isolatesthe upper layer protocols from the details of the underlying network.The Internet Protocol (IP), which isolates the upper layers from theunderlying network and handles the addressing and delivery of data, isusually described as TCP/IP's Network Layer.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Data&nbsp;Link&nbsp;Layer</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-438"></A>The reliable delivery of data across the underlying physical networkis handled by the Data Link Layer.
