While Chapters 1-3describe the TCP/IP protocols and how they work, now we begin to explore the network configuration process. The first step in this process is planning.Before configuring a host to run TCP/IP, you must have certaininformation. At the very least, every host must have a unique IPaddress and hostname.You should also decide on the items below before configuring a system:<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-3954"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-3957"></A></P><DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Default&nbsp;gateway&nbsp;address</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">If the system communicates with TCP/IP hosts that are not on its localnetwork, a default gateway address may be needed.

The network administrator is<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4004"></A>responsible for making andcommunicating decisions about overall network configuration. If youhave an established TCP/IP network, you can skip several sections inthis chapter, but you may still want to read about selecting hostnames,planning mail systems, and other topics that affect mature networks asmuch as they do new networks.</P><PCLASS="para">If you are creating a new TCP/IP network, you will have to make somebasic decisions. Will the new network connect to the Internet? If itwill, how is the connection to be made? How should the network numberbe chosen? How do I register a domain name? How do I choose hostnames?In the following sections, we cover the information you need to make these decisions.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="TCP2-CH-4-SECT-1">4.1 Connected and Non-Connected Networks </A></H2><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="TCP2-CH-4-IX-INTERNET-CONNECTED-OR-NON-CONNECTED-TO"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="TCP2-CH-4-IX-NETWORK-CONNECTED-OR-NOT-CONNECTED-TO-INTERNET"></A>First, you must decide whether or not your new network will be directlyconnected to the Internet. The Internet's administration makes adistinction between networks connected to the Internet and those thatare not connected.

On thesenetworks, TCP/IP is used for communication between the organization'svarious networks. Private networks that interconnect the various parts ofan organization are often called <EMCLASS="emphasis">enterprise networks</EM>.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4032"></A>When thoseprivate networks use the information services applications that are builton top of TCP/IP, particularly Web servers and browsers, to distributeinternal information, those networks are called <EMCLASS="emphasis">intranets</EM>.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4036"></A></P><PCLASS="para">There are a few basic reasons why many sites do not connect to theInternet. One reason is security. Connecting to any network gives morepeople access to your system. Connecting to a global network with<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4039"></A>millions of users is enough to scare any security expert. There is nodoubt about it: connecting to the Internet increases the security<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4042"></A>risks for your computer. <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch12_01.htm"TITLE="Network Security ">Chapter 12, <CITECLASS="chapter">Network Security </CITE></A>, covers some techniques for reducingthis risk.</P><PCLASS="para">Cost versus benefit is another consideration. Many organizations do notsee sufficient value in an Internet connection. For some organizations,low use or limited requirements, such as only needing email access, makethe cost of an Internet connection exceed the benefit. For others, theprimary reason for an Internet connection is to provide information abouttheir products. It is not necessary to connect the entire enterprisenetwork to the Internet to do this. It is often sufficient to connecta single Web server to the local Internet Service Provider (ISP)<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4047"></A>or to buy Web services from the ISP to provide information to your customers.</P><PCLASS="para">Other organizations consider an Internet connection an essentialrequirement. Educational and research institutions depend on the Internet as a source of information. Many companies use it as a means of delivering service and support to their customers.</P><PCLASS="para">You may have both types of networks: a &quot;non-connected&quot; enterprisenetwork sitting behind a security firewall, and a small &quot;connected&quot;network that provides services to your external customers and proxyservice for your internal users.</P><PCLASS="para">Unless you have carefully determined what your needs are and what anInternet connection will cost, you cannot know whether an Internetconnection is right for your organization. Your local Internet serviceprovider (ISP) can give you the various cost and performancealternatives. The next section offers ways to locate appropriateISPs. Regardless of whether or not you decide to connect yournetwork to the Internet, one thing is certain: you should build yourenterprise network using the TCP/IP protocols.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="TCP2-CH-4-SECT-1.1">4.1.1 Network Contacts </A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4055"></A>Choosing an ISP for your network can be confusing. Currently more than 5,000 ISPs operate in the United States alone.No attempt is made to list them all here. Instead we provide pointersto where you can obtain information on ISPs via email, newsgroups, theWeb, and in print.</P><PCLASS="para">Readers who want basic information about the Internet can start byreading a book about the Internet. My favorite is <EMCLASS="emphasis">The WholeInternet Users' Guide and Catalog</EM>, by Ed Krol (O'Reilly &amp;Associates). It provides a user-oriented focus on the Internetand a substantial list of ISPs.  Another book that provides a businessfocus on &quot;getting connected&quot; is <EMCLASS="emphasis">Getting Connected: Establishing aPresence on the Internet</EM>, by Kevin Dowd (O'Reilly &amp; Associates).</P><PCLASS="para">If you can send email to the Internet, request information about theISPs in your area by sending email to<ACLASS="email"HREF="mailto:zahner@aimnet.com"TITLE="zahner@aimnet.com">zahner@aimnet.com</A> with the words &quot;MY AREA CODE =&quot; followed by your areacode in both the subject line and the body of the message.

The List contains information onthousands of ISPs. The information is sorted into country code andtelephone area code lists to make it more useful.</P><PCLASS="para">Ask prospective ISPs about services as well as prices. Some ISPsspecialize in providing low-cost service to home users. They emphasizeprice.
