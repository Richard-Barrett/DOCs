Domain name service (DNS) andthe host table, explained in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch03_01.htm"TITLE="Network Services">Chapter 3</A>, perform thisfunction. You should plan to use both.</P><PCLASS="para">To configure her computer, a network user needs to know the domain name, her system's hostname, and the hostname and address of at least one name server.

You can download the applicationfrom <ACLASS="systemitem.url"HREF="ftp://rs.internic.net/templates/domain&#8211;template.txt">ftp://rs.internic.net/templates/domain-template.txt</A>.</P><PCLASS="para">Pre-select a domain name and have your primary domain name server upand running before you attempt to register the domain name. Use<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4470"></A><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">whois</B> as described in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch13_01.htm"TITLE="Internet Information Resources ">Chapter 13, <CITECLASS="chapter">Internet Information Resources </CITE></A>, to see if the name you want isin use.

If you don't want to run your ownserver, ask your ISP if they offer this service. If they don't, youmust either find a new ISP that does, or run the service yourself.</P><PCLASS="para">Having the primary server up and running doesn't mean that yourentire domain must be fully operational, but it does mean that a servermust be running to respond to basic queries. When asked,the server should answer that it is the name server for your domain.Configure the primary server as described in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring DNS Name Service ">Chapter 8</A>. Test it with<BCLASS="emphasis.bold">nslookup</B>. Once you are sure that it at least answers queriesabout itself, register the domain name.</P><PCLASS="para">Submit the domain name application form<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4482"></A>viaemail to <ACLASS="email"HREF="mailto:hostmaster@internic.net"TITLE="hostmaster@internic.net">hostmaster@internic.net</A> with a subject line containingthe words &quot;NEW DOMAIN&quot; followed by the name of your domain. Forexample, assuming the completed template is stored in the file<EMCLASS="emphasis">domain.application</EM> on a Solaris system, the following commandmight be used to mail it to the InterNIC for a domain named<EMCLASS="emphasis">nuts.com</EM>:</P><PCLASS="para"><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="screen"><PRECLASS="screen">% <BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Mail hostmaster@internic.net</B>Subject: <BCLASS="emphasis.bold">NEW DOMAIN nuts.com</B><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">~r domain.application</B>&quot;domain.application&quot; 49/2732<BCLASS="emphasis.bold">^D</B>EOT</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE></P><PCLASS="para">In response to your email, you receive a reply that contains a<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4496"></A>tracking number that you use to monitor the status of your domainregistration.</P><PCLASS="para">Use the domain name registration form to change or delete your existingdomain name registration. Just fill in the form with the correctedinformation and mail it to <ACLASS="email"HREF="mailto:hostmaster@internic.net"TITLE="hostmaster@internic.net">hostmaster@internic.net</A> with a subjectline that contains either &quot;MODIFY DOMAIN&quot; or &quot;REMOVE DOMAIN&quot;, asappropriate, followed by your domain name. In the very first field of theapplication form, item 0, ask for the type of registration action:either New (&quot;N&quot;), Modify (&quot;M&quot;), or Delete (&quot;D&quot;). Make sure the letter in this field matches the action indicated on the subject line when you mail in the application.</P><PCLASS="para">You're required to use email to submit the domain name application.The logic behind this is that if you don't have atleast email access to the Internet, you don't need an Internet domainname. This helps reduce the number of frivolous domain name requests,and it automates part of the registration, further reducing the burden of handling domain name requests.</P><PCLASS="para">Another thing that dramatically reduces the number of frivolous domainname applications is the $100 registration fee.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4502"></A>The registration service charges each domain $50 a year to bemaintained in the registry. The initial $100 fee covers the first twoyears. Question 9 asks if the InterNIC should send the bill for theregistration fee to you via email or postal mail. Answer with an &quot;E&quot;or a &quot;P&quot;.  If your &quot;bean counters&quot; will accept an email bill, go thatway. You'll get everything finished more quickly.</P><PCLASS="para">The application form is largely self-explanatory, but a few itemsrequire some thought. Two things may be confusing&nbsp;- handles and servers.One is the request for a <EMCLASS="emphasis">NIC handle</EM>.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4506"></A>You have a NIC handle onlyif you are registered in the <EMCLASS="emphasis">NIC white pages</EM>. The white pages(discussed in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch12_01.htm"TITLE="Network Security ">Chapter 12</A>) is a directory of information about users,networks, hosts, and domains. A NIC handle is a record identifier forthis directory. A personal NIC handle for a user entry is composed ofthe user's initials and perhaps a number. For example, my initials are<EMCLASS="emphasis">cwh</EM> and my NIC handle is <EMCLASS="emphasis">cwh3</EM>. It is unlikely that you willhave a handle unless you have contacted the NIC before. If you don'thave a handle, just leave it blank. The NIC will assign you one.</P><PCLASS="para">You're also asked for the names and addresses of your<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4514"></A>primary and secondary name servers.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4516"></A>The servers listed must beoperational and connected to the Internet.[7]Provide the full domain name of the primary server in response toquestion 7a; e.g. <EMCLASS="emphasis">almond.nuts.com</EM>. The primary server is usuallya name server located at your site, but not always. It isn't necessaryto provide your own primary server; and if you aren't directlyconnected to the Internet, you can't. Even though you are notconnected, you may still want to register your domain name with the NICif you have email access to the Internet. This allows you to use anemail address that clearly identifies your organization. In order todo this, the online service that receives your email must be able toprovide your primary name service. Check with them before you fill outthis form.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[7] <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring DNS Name Service ">Chapter 8</A> tells you how to get a name server up and running.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">The secondary server should be on a separate physical network from theprimary server. Putting it on a different network guarantees that othersites can look up information about your network, even if access to yournetwork is unavailable for some reason. A large organization may havemultiple independent networks, but for many sites this requirement meansasking another organization to provide a secondary name server. Who doyou ask?</P><PCLASS="para">Again, you should turn to the people who are providing your Internetaccess. The network that connects you to the Internet should providesecondary name servers as a service to its users. If they do not, theyshould be able to point you to other organizations that do provide theservice. It is even possible for two organizations who are bothapplying for new domains to provide secondary service for each other.In other words, you provide someone with a secondary server; in return,they provide a secondary server for you.</P><PCLASS="para">Read the instructions that come with the domain application.

This is thereverse of the normal process, which converts domain names to addresses.If your ISP provides your name service or your ISP assigned you anaddress from a block of its own addresses, you may not need to applyfor an <EMCLASS="emphasis">in-addr.arpa</EM> domain on your own.

You must ensure that hostnames are unique withinyour domain or subdomain, in the same way that host addresses must beunique within a network or subnet. But there is more to choosing a hostname than just making sure the name is unique. Choosing a hostname isa surprisingly emotional issue. Many people feel very strongly aboutthe name of their computer because they identify their computer withthemselves or their work.</P><PCLASS="para">RFC 1178 provides excellent guidelines on how to choose a hostname.Some key suggestions from these guidelines are:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Use real words that are short, easy to spell, and easy to remember. Thepoint of using hostnames instead of IP addresses is that they areeasier to use. If hostnames are difficult to spell and remember, theydefeat their own purpose.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Use theme names. For example, all hosts in a group could be named afterhuman movements: fall, jump, hop, skip, walk, run, stagger, wiggle,stumble, trip, limp, lurch, hobble, etc. Theme names are often easier tochoose than unrestricted names, and increase the sense of communityamong network users.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Avoid using project names, personal names, acronyms, numeric names,and technical jargon. Projects and users change over time. If you name acomputer after the person who is currently using it or the project itis currently assigned to, you will probably have to rename the computer inthe future. Use nicknames to identify the server function of a system,e.g., <EMCLASS="emphasis">www</EM>, <EMCLASS="emphasis">ftp</EM>, <EMCLASS="emphasis">ns</EM>, etc. Nicknames can easily movebetween systems if the server function moves. See the description ofCNAME records in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Configuring DNS Name Service ">Chapter 8</A> for information on creating nicknames.</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">The only requirement for a hostname is that it be unique within itsdomain. But a well-chosen hostname can save future work and make theuser happier.</P><PCLASS="para">Name service is the most basic network service, and it is one servicethat you will certainly run on your network. There are, however, otherservices that you should also include in your network planning process.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4563"></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch04_03.htm"TITLE="4.3 Planning Routing "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 4.3 Planning Routing "BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="TCP/IP Network Administration"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch04_05.htm"TITLE="4.5 Other Services "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 4.5 Other Services "BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">4.3 Planning Routing </TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">4.5 Other Services </TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
