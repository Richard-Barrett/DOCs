Servers are one of the tools that improvereliability. It is possible to create a peer-to-peer email network inwhich every end system directly sends and receives its own mail.However, relying on every system to deliver and collect the mailrequires that every system be properly administered and consistently up and running. This isn't practical, because many small systems areoffline for large portions of the day. Most networks use servers so thatonly a few systems need to be properly configured and operational forthe mail to go through.</P><PCLASS="para">The terminology that describes email servers is confusing because allof the server functions usually occur in one computer, and all of theterms are used interchangeably to refer to that system. In this textwe differentiate between these functions, but we expect you will do allof these tasks on one UNIX system running <BCLASS="emphasis.bold">sendmail</B>.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4601"></A>We use theseterms in the following manner:<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4603"></A></P><DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Mail server</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">The mail server collects incoming mail for other computers on thenetwork.

You don't need a gateway to go from one Internet host toanother because both systems use SMTP. You do need a gateway to gofrom SMTP to X.400 or to a proprietary mailer. In a pure TCP/IPnetwork, this function is not needed.</P></DD></DL><PCLASS="para">The mail server is the most important component of a reliable systembecause it eliminates reliance on the user's system. A centrallycontrolled, professionally operated server collects the mail regardlessof whether or not the end system is operational.</P><PCLASS="para">The relay host also contributes to the reliability of the emailsystem. If mail cannot be immediately delivered by the relay host, itis queued and processed later. An end system also queues mail, but ifit is shut down no attempts can be made to deliver queued mail untilthe system is back online. The mail server and the mail relay areoperated 24 hours a day.</P><PCLASS="para">The design of most TCP/IP email networks is based on the followingguidelines:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Use a mail server to collect mail, and POP<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4637"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4639"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-4641"></A>or IMAP to deliver the mail.</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Use a mail relay host to forward mail.
