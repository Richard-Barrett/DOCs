You have installed TCP/IP in the kernel, configuredthe network interface, and configured routing. At this point, you havecompleted all of the configuration tasks required to run TCP/IP on aUNIX system. While none of the remaining tasks are <EMCLASS="emphasis">required</EM> forTCP/IP software to operate, they are necessary for making the networkmore friendly and useful.In the next two chapters, we look at how toconfigure basic TCP/IP network services. Perhaps the most important ofthese is name service.</P><PCLASS="para">Strictly speaking, name service<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-9193"></A>is not necessary for computers to communicate. It is, as the nameimplies, a service&nbsp;- specifically, a service intended to make thenetwork more user-friendly. Computers are perfectly happy with IPaddresses, but people prefer names. The importance of name service isindicated by the amount of coverage it has in thisbook. <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch03_01.htm"TITLE="Network Services">Chapter 3, <CITECLASS="chapter">Network Services</CITE></A>, discusses <EMCLASS="emphasis">why</EM> name service is needed;this chapter covers <EMCLASS="emphasis">how</EM> it is configured, and <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appc_01.htm"TITLE="A named Reference">Appendix C, <CITECLASS="appendix">A named Reference</CITE></A>,covers the <EMCLASS="emphasis">details</EM> of the nameserver configuration commands.This chapter provides sufficient information to show you how toconfigure BIND 4 software to run on your system.[1]But if you want to knowmore about why something is done, don't hesitate to refer to<ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch03_01.htm"TITLE="Network Services">Chapter 3</A> and <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appc_01.htm"TITLE="A named Reference">Appendix C</A>.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] BIND 4 is the version of domain name software used on most UNIX systems.Another version of DNS software&nbsp;- BIND 8&nbsp;- is also available.

It learns the answer to every nameserverquery from some remote server. Once it learns an answer, the servercaches the answer and uses it to answer future queries for the sameinformation. All nameservers use cached information in this manner,but a caching-only server depends on this technique for all of itsnameserver information. It is not considered an authoritative (ormaster) server, because all of the information it provides issecondhand.Only a boot file and a cache file are required for a caching-onlyconfiguration. But the most common configuration also includes aloopback file. <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-9297"></A>This is probably the most common nameserverconfiguration, and apart from the resolver-only configuration, it is<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-9300"></A>the easiest to configure.</P></DD></DL><PCLASS="para">A server may be any one of these configurations or, as is often thecase, it may combine elements of more than one type of configuration.However, all systems run the resolver, so let's begin by examining theconfiguration of the client side of the DNS software.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-9303"></A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch07_08.htm"TITLE="7.8 Summary "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 7.8 Summary "BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="TCP/IP Network Administration"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch08_02.htm"TITLE="8.2 Configuring the Resolver "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 8.2 Configuring the Resolver "BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">7.8 Summary </TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">8.2 Configuring the Resolver </TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
