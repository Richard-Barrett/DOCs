A bad subnet mask is indicated whenthe host can reach other hosts on its local subnet and remote hostson distant networks, but it cannot reach hosts on other localsubnets. <BCLASS="emphasis.bold">ifconfig</B> quickly reveals if a bad subnet mask is set.</P><PCLASS="para">An incorrectly set IP address can be a subtle problem.

In this case, using <BCLASS="emphasis.bold">ifconfig</B> will reveal the incorrect address. However, if the host part of the addressis wrong, the problem can be more difficult to detect. A small system,such as a PC that only connects out to other systems and never acceptsincoming connections, can run for a long time with the wrong addresswithout its user noticing the problem. Additionally, the system thatsuffers the ill effects may not be the one that is misconfigured. Itis possible for someone to accidentally use your IP address on hissystem, and for his mistake to cause your system intermittentcommunications problems. An example of this problem is discussedlater. This type of configuration error cannot be discovered by<BCLASS="emphasis.bold">ifconfig</B>, because the error is on a remote host.

Use <EMCLASS="emphasis">Unshielded Twisted Pair</EM> (UTP) cable, ideallyCategory 5 cable, to create a 10BaseT Ethernet or 100BaseT FastEthernet that wires equipment located in the user's office to a hubsecurely stored in a wire closet. The network components in the user'soffice should be sufficiently isolated from the network so that damageto those components does not damage the entire network. The newnetwork will solve your collision problem and reduce the amount ofhardware troubleshooting you are called upon to do.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15873"></A></P><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="TCP2-CH-11-SECT-4.4.1">11.4.4.1 Network hardware problems </A></H4><PCLASS="para">Some of the tests discussed in this section can show a network hardware<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15877"></A>problem. If a hardware problem is indicated, contact the peopleresponsible for the hardware.

If the problem appears<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15883"></A>to be in a wide area network, contact the management of that network.Don't sit on a problem expecting it to go away. It could easily getworse.</P><PCLASS="para">If the problem is in your local area network, you will have to handleit yourself. Some tools, such as the cable tester described above, canhelp. But frequently the only way to approach a hardware problem is bybrute force&nbsp;- disconnecting pieces of hardware until you find the onecausing the problem. It is most convenient to do this at the switch or hub. If you identify a device causing the problem, repair<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15886"></A>or replace it. Remember that the problem can be the cable itself, ratherthan any particular device.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15889"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-15890"></A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch11_03.htm"TITLE="11.3 Testing Basic Connectivity "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 11.3 Testing Basic Connectivity "BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="TCP/IP Network Administration"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch11_05.htm"TITLE="11.5 Checking Routing "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 11.5 Checking Routing "BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">11.3 Testing Basic Connectivity </TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">11.5 Checking Routing </TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
