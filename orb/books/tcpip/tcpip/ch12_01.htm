But by<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16830"></A>nature, network access and computer security work at cross-purposes. A network is a data highway designed to increase access tocomputer systems, while security is designed to control access.Providing network security is a balancing act between open access andsecurity.</P><PCLASS="para">The highway analogy is very appropriate. Like a highway, the networkprovides equal access for all&nbsp;- welcome visitors as well as unwelcomeintruders. At home, you provide security for your possessions bylocking your house, not by blocking the streets. Likewise, networksecurity generally means providing adequate security on individual hostcomputers, not providing security directly on the network.</P><PCLASS="para">In very small towns, where people know each other, doors are often leftunlocked. But in big cities, doors have deadbolts and chains. In thelast decade, the Internet has grown from a small town of a few thousandusers to a big city of millions of users. Just as the anonymity of abig city turns neighbors into strangers, the growth of the Internet hasreduced the level of trust<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16836"></A>between network neighbors. The ever-increasing need for computer security is an unfortunate side effect.Growth, however, is not all bad. In the same way that a big cityoffers more choices and more services, the expanded network providesincreased services. For most of us, security consciousness is a smallprice to pay for network access.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16839"></A>Network break-ins have increased as the network has grown and becomemore impersonal, but it is easy to exaggerate the extent of these security breaches. Over-reacting to the threat of break-ins may hinder theway you use the network. Don't make the cure worse than the disease.The best advice about network security isto use common sense.RFC 1244, <EMCLASS="emphasis">Site Security Handbook</EM>, by Holbrook, Reynold, et al.,states this principle very well:<BLOCKQUOTECLASS="blockquote"><PCLASS="para">Common sense is the most appropriate tool that can be used to establishyour security policy.

We want tofind a program that &quot;fixes&quot; the network security problem. Few of uswant to write a paper on network security policies and procedures.However, a well-thought-out security plan will help you decide whatneeds to be protected, how much you are willing to invest in protectingit, and who will be responsible for carrying out the steps to protectit.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="TCP2-CH-12-SECT-1.1">12.1.1 Assessing the Threat </A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="TCP2-CH-12-IX-THREAT-ASSESSING"></A>The first step toward developing an effective network security plan isto assess the threat that connection presents to your systems. RFC 1244identifies three distinct types of security threats usually associatedwith network connectivity:</P><DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Unauthorized access</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">A break-in by an unauthorized person.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Disclosure of information</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Any problem that causes the disclosure of valuable or sensitiveinformation to people who should not have access to the information.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">Denial of service</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Any problem that makes it difficult or impossible for the system tocontinue to perform productive work.</P></DD></DL><PCLASS="para">Assess these threats in relation to the number of users who would beaffected, as well as to the sensitivity of the information that mightbe compromised. For some organizations, break-ins are an embarrassmentthat can undermine the confidence that others have in the organization. Intruders tend to target government and academic organizations thatwill be embarrassed by the break-in. But for mostorganizations, unauthorized access is not a major problem unless itinvolves one of the other threats: disclosure of information or denialof service.</P><PCLASS="para">Assessing the threat of information disclosure<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16877"></A>depends on the type ofinformation that could be compromised. While no system with highlyclassified information should ever be directly connected to theInternet, systems with other types of sensitive information might be connected without undue hazard. In most cases, files such as personnel and medical records, corporate plans, and credit reports can be adequately protectedby standard UNIX file security procedures. However, if therisk of liability in case of disclosure is great, the host may choose not to be connected to the Internet.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16880"></A>Denial of service can be a severe problem if it impacts many users or amajor mission of your organization. Some systems can be connected tothe network with little concern. The benefit of connecting individualworkstations and small servers to the Internet generally outweighs thechance of having service interrupted for the individuals and smallgroups served by these systems. Other systems may be vital to thesurvival of your organization. The threat of losing the services of amission-critical system must be evaluated seriously before connectingsuch a system to the network.</P><PCLASS="para">In his class on computer security, Brent Chapman<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16883"></A>classifies information security threats into three categories: threats to the secrecy, availability, and integrity of data. Secrecy<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16885"></A>is the needto prevent the disclosure of sensitive information. Availability meansthat you want information and information processing resources availablewhen they are needed; a denial-of-service attack disrupts availability.The need for the integrity of information is equally obvious, but itslink to computer security is more subtle. Once someone has gainedunauthorized access to a system, the integrity of the information on<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16888"></A>that system is in doubt. Furthermore, some intruders just wantto compromise the integrity of data. We are all familiar with caseswhere intruders gain access to a Web server and change the data on theserver in order to embarrass the organization that runs the Web site.Thinking about the impact network threats have on your data can makeit easier to assess the threat.</P><PCLASS="para">Network threats are not, of course, the only threats to computer security,or the only reasons for denial of service. Natural disasters<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16892"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16894"></A>and internal threats (threats from people who havelegitimate access to a system)are also serious. Network security has had a lot of publicity, so it'sa fashionable thing to worry about; but more computer time has probablybeen lost because of fires<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16896"></A>than has ever been lost because of networksecurity problems. Similarly, more data has probably been improperlydisclosed by authorized users than by unauthorized break-ins. This booknaturally emphasizes network security, but network security is only partof a larger security plan that includes physical security and disasterrecovery plans.</P><PCLASS="para">Many traditional (non-network) security threats are handled, in part,<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16899"></A>by physical security. Don't forget to provide an adequate level ofphysical security for your network equipment and cables. Again, theinvestment in physical security should be based on your realisticassessment of the threat.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16902"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="TCP2-CH-12-SECT-1.2">12.1.2 Distributed Control </A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="TCP2-CH-12-IX-DISTRIBUTED-CONTROL"></A>One approach to network security is to distribute responsibility for,and control over, segments of a large network to small groups withinthe organization. This approach involves a large number of people insecurity, and runs counter to the school of thought that seeks toincrease security by centralizing control. However, distributingresponsibility and control to small groups can create an environment ofsmall networks composed of trusted hosts. Using the analogy of smalltowns and big cities, it is similar to creating a neighborhood watch toreduce risks by giving people connection with their neighbors, mutualresponsibility for one another, and control over their own fates.</P><PCLASS="para">Additionally, distributing security responsibilities formallyrecognizes one of the realities of network security&nbsp;- most securityactions take place on individual systems. The managers of thesesystems must know that they are responsible for security, and thattheir contribution to network security is recognized and appreciated.If people are expected to do a job, they must be empowered to do it.</P><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="TCP2-CH-12-SECT-1.2.1">12.1.2.1 Use subnets to distribute control </A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16913"></A>Subnets are a possible tool for distributing network control. A subnet<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16916"></A>administrator should be appointed when a subnet is created. She is then responsible for the security of the networkand for assigning IP addresses to the devices connected tothe networks. Assigning IP addresses gives the subnetadministrator some control over who connects to the subnet. Italso helps to ensure that she knows each system connected and who is responsible for that system. When thesubnet administrator gives a system an IP address, she also delegatescertain security responsibilities to the system's administrator.Likewise, when the system administrator grants a user an account, theuser takes on certain security responsibilities.</P><PCLASS="para">The hierarchy of responsibility<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-16920"></A>flows from the network administrator,to the subnet administrator, to the system administrator, and finallyto the user. At each point in this hierarchy the individuals are givenresponsibilities and the power to carry them out. To support thisstructure, it is important for users to know what they are responsible for and how to carry out that responsibility. The networksecurity policy described in the next section provides thisinformation.</P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect3"><H4CLASS="sect3"><ACLASS="title"NAME="TCP2-CH-12-SECT-1.2.2">12.1.2.2 Use mailing lists to distribute information </A></H4><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="TCP2-CH-12-IX-MAILING-LISTS-FOR-DISTRIBUTING-SECURITY-INFORMATION"></A>If your site adopts distributed control, you must develop asystem for disseminating security information to each group. Mailinglists for each administrative level can be used for this purpose. Thenetwork administrator receives security information from outsideauthorities, filters out irrelevant material, and forwards the relevantmaterial to the subnet administrators. Subnet administrators forwardthe relevant parts to their system administrators,who in turn forward what they consider important to the individual users.The filtering of information at each level ensures that individuals getthe information they need, without receiving too much.If too much unnecessary material is distributed, usersbegin to ignore everything they receive.</P><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="TCP2-CH-12-IX-SECURITY-SOURCES-OF-INFORMATION"></A>At the top of this information structure is the information that thenetwork administrator receives from outside authorities.
