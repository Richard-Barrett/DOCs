Encryption encodes the data in a form that can beread only by systems that have the &quot;key&quot; to the encoding scheme. The originaltext, called the &quot;clear text,&quot;<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18333"></A>is encrypted using an encryption device(hardware or software) and an encryption key. This produces encoded<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18335"></A>text, which is called the cipher.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18338"></A>To recreate the &quot;clear text,&quot; thecipher must be decrypted<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18340"></A>using the same type of encryption device and an appropriate key.</P><PCLASS="para">Largely because of spy novels and World War II movies, encryption is oneof the first things that people think of when they think of security.However, encryption is not always applicable to network security.Encrypting data for transmission across a network requires that thesame encryption equipment, or software, be used at both ends of thedata exchange. Unless you control both ends of the network and canensure that the same encryption device is available, it is difficult touse end-to-end data encryption.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18343"></A>For this reason, encryption is mostcommonly used<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18346"></A>to exchange data in individual applications where thesoftware at both ends of the network is defined by a single vendor.For example, a Web server and a Web browser from the same vendor usethe same encryption. Encrypting all types of data is limited toplaces where the entire system is under the control of a singleauthority, such as military networks, private networks, individualsystems, or when the individuals at both ends of the communication canreach personal agreement on the encryption technique and key.</P><PCLASS="para">What is needed to make encryption truly useful in a global network areuniversally recognized encryption standards and a trusted infrastructureto support those standards.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18350"></A><EMCLASS="emphasis">Public-key encryption</EM> is the technology thatwill make encryption an important security technology for an open global<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18353"></A>network like the Internet. Public-key systems encode the clear-text witha key that is widely known and publicly available, but the cipher canonly be decoded back to clear-text with a secret key. This means thatDan can look up Kristin's public key in a trusted database and use it toencode a message to her that no one else can read. Even though everyoneon the Internet has access to the public key, only Kristin can decrypt themessage using her secret key. Kristin can then look up Dan's public keyto encrypt her reply. This encrypted communication takes place withoutDan or Kristin ever divulging their secret keys. However, to ensure that the keys have not been tampered with, public-keycryptography requires a trusted system for distributing public keys.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18356"></A>And because the encrypting key is available to everyone, it requires adigital signature system<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18358"></A>to authenticate that a message is really from whom it purports to be from.</P><PCLASS="para">Government and industry are working on the standards and infrastructurefor public-key cryptography. The type of encryption used in theexamples in this section is symmetric encryption.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-18361"></A>It requires thatthe same encryption technique and the same secret key is used forboth encrypting and decrypting the message. It does not rely onpublic keys, digital signatures, or a widely accepted infrastructure,but its usefulness is limited. Truly effective public-key cryptographymust wait for the creation of a trusted public-key infrastructure.</P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="TCP2-CH-12-SECT-6.0.1">12.6.1 When is symmetric encryption useful? </A></H3><PCLASS="para">Before using encryption, decide why you want to encrypt the data,whether the data should be protected with encryption, andwhether the data should even be stored on a networked computersystem.</P><PCLASS="para">A few valid reasons for encrypting data are:</P><ULCLASS="itemizedlist"><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">To prevent casual browsers from viewing sensitive data files</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">To prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">To prevent privileged users (e.g., system administrators) from viewingprivate data files</P></LI><LICLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">To complicate matters for intruders who attempt to search through asystem's files</P></LI></UL><PCLASS="para">Encryption is not a substitute for good computer security. Encryptioncan protect sensitive or personal information from casual snooping,but it should never be the sole means of protecting criticalinformation.  Encryption systems can be broken, and encrypted data canbe deleted or corrupted just like any other data. So don't letencryption lull you into a false sense of security. Some informationis so sensitive or critical that it should not be stored on anetworked computer system, even if it is encrypted. Encryption is onlya small part of a complete security system.
