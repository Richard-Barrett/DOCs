TCP/IP is now universallyrecognized as the pre-eminent communications protocol for linkingtogether diverse computer systems. The importance of interoperable datacommunications and global computer networks is no longer debated. Butthat was not always the case. When I wrote the first edition of this book,IPX was far and away the leading PC communicationsprotocol. Microsoft did not bundle communications protocols in theiroperating system. Corporate networks were so dependent on SNA thatmany corporate network administrators had not even heard of TCP/IP.Even UNIX, the mother of TCP/IP, nursed a large number of pure UUCPnetworks. Back then I felt compelled to tout the importance of TCP/IPby pointing out that it was used on thousands of networks and hundreds ofthousands of computers. How times have changed! Today we count the hostsand users connected to the Internet in the tens of millions. And theInternet is only the tip of the TCP/IP iceberg. The largest market forTCP/IP is in the corporate<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-20"></A>&quot;intranet.&quot; An intranet is a private TCP/IPnetwork used to disseminate information within the enterprise. Thecompeting network technologies have shrunk to niche markets where theyfill special needs&nbsp;- while TCP/IP has grown to be the communicationssoftware that links the world.</P><PCLASS="para">The acceptance of TCP/IP as a worldwide standard and the size of itsglobal user base are not the only things that have changed. In 1991 Ilamented the lack of adequate documentation. At the time it was difficultfor a<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-24"></A>network administrator to find the information he or she neededto do the job. Since that time there has been an explosion of booksabout TCP/IP and the Internet. However, there are still too few books that concentrate on what a system administrator really needs to know about TCP/IP administration and too many books that try to tell you how to surf the Web. In this book I strive to focus on TCP/IP and UNIX, and not to be distracted by the phenomenon of the Internet.</P><PCLASS="para">I am very proud of the first edition of <EMCLASS="emphasis">TCP/IP NetworkAdministration</EM>. In the second edition, I have done everything I canto maintain the essential character of the book while making it better.The Domain Name Service material has been updated to cover the latestversion of the<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-30"></A>BIND 4 software. The email configuration is now based onsendmail<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-32"></A>version 8, and the operating system examples are from the currentversions of Solaris and Linux. The routing protocol coverage has beenexpanded to include<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35"></A>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Border Gateway<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-37"></A>Protocol (BGP). I have also added new topics such as<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-39"></A>one-time passwords and configuration servers based on Dynamic Host<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-42"></A>Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Bootstrap Protocol<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-44"></A>(BOOTP). Despite the additional topics, the book has been kept to a reasonable length.</P><PCLASS="para">The bulk of this edition is derived directly from the first edition ofthe book. To emphasize both that times have changed and that my focuson practical information has not, I have left the introductory paragraphsfrom the first edition intact.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="TCP2-CH-0-SECT-0.1">Foreword from the First Edition</A></H2><PCLASS="para">The Internet, the world's largest network, grew from fewer than 6,000computers at the end of 1986 to more than 600,000 computers five yearslater.[1]This explosive growth demonstrates<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-53"></A>the incredible demand for networkservices. This growth has taken place despite a lack of practicalinformation for network administrators. Most administrators havebeen forced to content themselves with <BCLASS="emphasis.bold">man</B> pages, or protocoldocuments and scholarly texts written from the point of view of theprotocol designer. For practical information, most of us have reliedon the advice of friends who had already networked their computers.This book addresses the lack of information by providing practical,detailed network information for the<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-57"></A>UNIX system administrator.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] These figures are taken from page 4 of RFC 1296, <EMCLASS="emphasis">Internet Growth(1981-1991)</EM>, by M. Lottor, SRI International. Read this book andyou'll learn what an RFC is, and how to get your own free copy!</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">Networks have grown so extravagantly because they provide an importantservice. It is in the nature of computers to generate and processinformation, but this information is frequently useless unless it canbe shared with the people who need it. The network is the vehicle thatenables data to be easily shared. Once you network your computer,you'll never want to be stuck on an isolated system again.</P><PCLASS="para">The common thread that ties the enormous Internet together is TCP/IPnetwork software. TCP/IP is a set of communications protocols thatdefine how different types of computers talk to each other. This is<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-62"></A>a book about building your own network based on TCP/IP. It is botha tutorial covering the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; of TCP/IP networking, and areference manual for the details about specific network programs.</P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">&nbsp;</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="TCP/IP Network Administration"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf1_02.htm"TITLE="Audience"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: Audience"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">&nbsp;</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">Audience</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><PCLASS="nav"><FONTSIZE="-1">[ <AHREF="../index.htm"TITLE="The Networking CD Bookshelf">Library Home</A> | <AHREF="../dnsbind/index.htm"TITLE="DNS &amp; BIND">DNS &amp; BIND</A> | <AHREF="index.htm"TITLE="TCP/IP Network Administration">TCP/IP</A> | <AHREF="../sendmail/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail">sendmail</A> | <AHREF="../smdref/index.htm"TITLE="sendmail Desktop Reference">sendmail Reference</A> | <AHREF="../firewall/index.htm"TITLE="Building Internet Firewalls">Firewalls</A> | <AHREF="../puis/index.htm"TITLE="Practical UNIX &amp; Internet Security">Practical Security</A> ]</FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
