It also has a few important features (e.g., aliases; see <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch03_01.htm"TITLE="Customizing Your Environment">Chapter 3</A>) that make it easier touse in general.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-519"></A></P><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="KSH-CH-1-SECT-3.1">1.3.1 The Korn Shell</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-523"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-525"></A>The Korn shell, or <EMCLASS="emphasis">ksh</EM>, was invented by David Korn of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in the mid-1980s. It is almost entirely upwardly compatible with the Bourne shell, [1]<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-531"></A>which means that Bourne shell users can use it right away, andall system utilities that use the Bourne shellcan use the Korn shell instead.  In fact, some systems have the Korn shell installed as if it were the Bourne shell.  </P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] With a few extremely minor exceptions.

As of USL's version of UNIX calledSystem V Release 4 (SVR4 for short, 1989), itwas distributed with all <SPANCLASS="acronym">USL</SPAN> UNIX systems, all third-partyversions of UNIX derived from SVR4, and many other versions.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-539"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-543"></A></P><PCLASS="para">USL's distributed version of the Korn shell, datedNovember 16, 1988, is what this book describes.Other versions are summarized briefly in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appa_01.htm"TITLE="Related Shells">Appendix A</A>.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-547"></A></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="sect2"><H3CLASS="sect2"><ACLASS="title"NAME="KSH-CH-1-SECT-3.2">1.3.2 Features of the Korn Shell</A></H3><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-551"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-553"></A>Although the Bourne shell is still known as the &quot;standard&quot;shell, the Korn shell is becoming increasingly popular andis destined to replace it. In addition to its Bourne shellcompatibility, it includes the best features of the C shell as well as several advantages of its own.It also runs more efficiently than any previous shell.</P><PCLASS="para">The Korn shell's command-line editing modes are the featuresthat tend to attract people to it at first.With command-line editing, it's much easier to go back and fix mistakes than it is with the C shell's history mechanism-and the Bourne shell doesn't letyou do this at all.  </P><PCLASS="para">The other major Korn shell feature that is intended mostly forinteractive users is job control. As <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch08_01.htm"TITLE="Process Handling">Chapter 8</A> explains,job control gives you the ability to stop, start, and pauseany number of commands at the same time. This feature wasborrowed almost verbatim from the C shell.</P><PCLASS="para">The rest of the Korn shell's important advantages are mainlymeant for shell customizers and programmers. It hasmany new options and variables for customization, and itsprogramming features have been significantly expanded toinclude function definition, more control structures, built-in regular expressions and integer arithmetic, advanced I/O control, and more.  </P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_02.htm"TITLE="1.2 Scope of This Book"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 1.2 Scope of This Book"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Learning the Korn Shell"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Learning the Korn Shell"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_04.htm"TITLE="1.4 Getting the Korn Shell"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 1.4 Getting the Korn Shell"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">1.2 Scope of This Book</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">1.4 Getting the Korn Shell</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><IMGSRC="../gifs/smnavbar.gif"USEMAP="#map"BORDER="0"ALT="The UNIX CD Bookshelf Navigation"><MAPNAME="map"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="0,0,73,21"HREF="../index.htm"ALT="The UNIX CD Bookshelf"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="74,0,163,21"HREF="../upt/index.htm"ALT="UNIX Power Tools"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="164,0,257,21"HREF="../unixnut/index.htm"ALT="UNIX in a Nutshell"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="258,0,321,21"HREF="../vi/index.htm"ALT="Learning the vi Editor"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="322,0,378,21"HREF="../sedawk/index.htm"ALT="sed &amp; awk"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="379,0,438,21"HREF="index.htm"ALT="Learning the Korn Shell"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="439,0,514,21"HREF="../lrnunix/index.htm"ALT="Learning the UNIX Operating System"></MAP></DIV></BODY></HTML>
