Concepts involved in desk work usually include memos, phone calls, letters,forms, etc. The tools on or in your desk that you use todeal with these things include paper, staples, envelopes, pens, a telephone, a calculator, etc. Every one of these has aset of characteristics that express how you use it; suchcharacteristics range from location on your desk or in a drawer(for simple tools) to more sophisticated things like which numbersthe memory buttons on your phone are set to. Taken together,these characteristics make up your desk's look and feel.</P><PCLASS="para">You customize the look and feel of yourdesk environment by putting pens where you can most easily reachthem, programming your phone buttons, etc. In general,the more customization you have done, the more tailored to yourpersonal needs-and therefore the more productive-your environment is.</P><PCLASS="para">Similarly, UNIX shells present you withsuch concepts as files, directories, and standard inputand output, while UNIX itself gives youtools to work with these, such as file manipulationcommands, text editors, and print queues. Your UNIX environment'slook and feel is determined by your keyboard and display, of course, but also by how you set up your directories, where you put eachkind of file, and what names you give to files, directories, and commands.There are also more sophisticated ways of customizing your shellenvironment.<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-3831"></A></P><PCLASS="para">The most basic means of customization that the Korn shell providesare these:<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-3833"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-3835"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-3837"></A></P><PCLASS="para"></P><DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Aliases</B></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Synonyms for commands or command stringsthat you can define for convenience.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Options</B></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Controls for various aspects of your environment,which you can turn on and off.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Variables</B></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Place-holders for information thattell the shell and other programshow to behave under various circumstances.</P></DD></DL><PCLASS="para">There are also more complex ways to customize your environment, mainly the ability toprogram the shell, which we will see in later chapters. In thischapter, we will cover the techniques listed above.</P><PCLASS="para">While most of the customizations obtainable with the abovetechniques are straightforward and apply to everyday UNIX use, others are rather arcane and require in-depth technical knowledge to understand. Most of this chapter will concentrate on the former. Because we want to explain things from the perspectiveof tasks you may want to perform, rather than that of the specificfeatures of the Korn shell, a few little details may fall throughthe cracks (such as miscellaneous options to certain commands).We suggest you look in <ACLASS="xref"HREF="appb_01.htm"TITLE="Reference Lists">Appendix B, Reference Lists</A> for this type of information.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1"><H2CLASS="sect1"><ACLASS="title"NAME="KSH-CH-3-SECT-1">3.1 The .profile File</A></H2><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="KSH-CH-3-IX-PROFILE"></A>If you want to customize your environment,it is most important to know about a file called <EMCLASS="emphasis">.profile</EM> in your home(login) directory. This is a file of shell commands, also calleda shell script, that the Korn shell reads and runs wheneveryou log in to your system.  </P><PCLASS="para">If you use a large machine in anoffice or department, the odds are good that your systemadministrator has already set up a <EMCLASS="emphasis">.profile</EM> file for you that containsa few standard things. This is one of the &quot;hidden&quot; files mentionedin <ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch01_01.htm"TITLE="Korn Shell Basics">Chapter 1, Korn Shell Basics</A>; <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-3868"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-3870"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-3873"></A>other common hidden files include <EMCLASS="emphasis">.X11Startup</EM> (for the XWindow System), <EMCLASS="emphasis">.emacs</EM> (for the GNU Emacs editor),and <EMCLASS="emphasis">.mailrc</EM> (for the UNIX mail program).</P><PCLASS="para">Your <EMCLASS="emphasis">.profile</EM>, together with the environment filethat we will see towards the end of this chapter,will be the source of practically allof the customizations we will discuss here as wellas in subsequent chapters. <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-3880"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-3882"></A>Therefore it is veryimportant for you to become comfortable with a text editorlike <EMCLASS="emphasis">vi</EM> or <EMCLASS="emphasis">emacs</EM> so that you can try whatevercustomization techniques strike your fancy.</P><PCLASS="para">Bear in mind, however, that if you add commands to your <EMCLASS="emphasis">.profile</EM>,they will not take effect until you log out and log back in again, or type the command <BCLASS="emphasis.bold">login</B>.[1]Of course, you need not immediately add customizationcommands to your <EMCLASS="emphasis">.profile</EM>-you can always just testthem by typing them in yourself.</P><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="footnote"><PCLASS="para">[1] This has the same effect as logging out and logging in again,although it actually replaces your login session with a new onewithout explicitly terminating the old session.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><PCLASS="para">If you already have a <EMCLASS="emphasis">.profile</EM>, it's likely to containlines similar to some of these:</P><PCLASS="para"><BLOCKQUOTECLASS="screen"><PRECLASS="screen">PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/etc:/usr/ucb:/local/bin:stty stop ^S intr ^C erase ^? EDITOR=/usr/local/bin/emacsSHELL=/bin/kshexport EDITOR</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE></P><PCLASS="para">These commands set up a basic environment for you, soyou probably shouldn't change them until you learn aboutwhat they do-which you will by the end of this chapter.When you edit your <EMCLASS="emphasis">.profile</EM>, just put your additionallines in afterwards.  <ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-3898"></A></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch02_06.htm"TITLE="2.6 Finger Habits"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 2.6 Finger Habits"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="Learning the Korn Shell"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="Learning the Korn Shell"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch03_02.htm"TITLE="3.2 Aliases"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 3.2 Aliases"BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">2.6 Finger Habits</TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">3.2 Aliases</TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><IMGSRC="../gifs/smnavbar.gif"USEMAP="#map"BORDER="0"ALT="The UNIX CD Bookshelf Navigation"><MAPNAME="map"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="0,0,73,21"HREF="../index.htm"ALT="The UNIX CD Bookshelf"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="74,0,163,21"HREF="../upt/index.htm"ALT="UNIX Power Tools"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="164,0,257,21"HREF="../unixnut/index.htm"ALT="UNIX in a Nutshell"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="258,0,321,21"HREF="../vi/index.htm"ALT="Learning the vi Editor"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="322,0,378,21"HREF="../sedawk/index.htm"ALT="sed &amp; awk"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="379,0,438,21"HREF="index.htm"ALT="Learning the Korn Shell"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="439,0,514,21"HREF="../lrnunix/index.htm"ALT="Learning the UNIX Operating System"></MAP></DIV></BODY></HTML>
