In fact, an early release of theoperating system went by the name PWB (Programmer'sWork Bench).</P><PCLASS="para">When Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie first wrote UNIX at AT&amp;TBell Labs, it wasfor their own use, and for their friends and co-workers.Utility programs were added by various people as they hadproblems to solve. Because Bell Labs wasn't in the computerbusiness, source code was given out to universities for anominal fee. Brilliant researchers wrote their own softwareand added it to UNIX in a spree of creative anarchy that hasn'tbeen equaled since, except perhaps in the introductionof the<SPANCLASS="link">X Window System (<ACLASS="linkend"HREF="ch01_31.htm"TITLE="The X Window System ">1.31</A>)</SPAN>.</P><PCLASS="para">Unlike most other operating systems, where free softwareremains an unsupported add-on, UNIX has taken as its own thework of thousands of independent programmers. During thecommercialization of UNIX within the past ten years, thisincorporation of outside software has slowed down, but notstopped entirely, especially in the university environment.</P><PCLASS="para">A book on UNIX Power Tools&#174; therefore inevitably <EMCLASS="emphasis">has</EM>to focus not just on add-on utilities (though we do includemany of those) but on how to use clever features of the manyutilities that have been made part of UNIX over the years.</P><PCLASS="para">UNIX is also important to power users because it's one of the lastpopular operating systems that doesn't force you to work behind aninterface of menus and windows and a mouse witha &quot;one-size(-doesn't)-fit-all&quot; programming interface.Yes, you can use UNIX interfaces with windows and menus&nbsp;- andthey can be great time savers in a lot of cases.But UNIX also gives you building blocks that, with some training andpractice, will give you many more choices than any software designercan cram onto a set of menus.If you learn to use UNIX and its utilities from the command line,you don't have to be a programmer to do very powerful things witha few keystrokes.</P><PCLASS="para">So, it's also essential that this book teach you some of theunderlying principles that make UNIX such a tinkerer's paradise.</P><PCLASS="para">In the body of this book, we assume that you are alreadymoderately familiar with UNIX-a journeyman hacker wanting tobecome a master. But at the same time, we don't want to leavebeginners entirely at sea, so in this chapter, we include somefundamental concepts. We've tried to intersperse some simple tips andtricks to keep things interesting, but the ratio of conceptarticles to tips is much higher than in any other part ofthe book. The concepts covered are also much more basic. Ifyou aren't a beginner, you can safely skip this chapter, thoughwe may bounce you back here if you don't understand somethinglater in the book.</P><PCLASS="para">Don't expect a complete introduction to UNIX-if you need that,buy an introductory book. What you'll find here is a selectionof key concepts that you'll need to understand to progress beyond the beginnerstage, and answers to frequently asked questions and problems.In some ways, consider this introduction a teaser. If youare a beginner, we wantto show you enough of UNIX to whet your appetite for more.</P><PCLASS="para">Also, don't expect everything to be in order. Because we don'twant you to get in the habit of reading through each chapterfrom beginning to end, as in most books, the articles in thischapter are in loose order. We've tried not to make you jumparound too much, but we've also avoided a lot of thetransitional material that makes reading most books a chore.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1info"><PCLASS="SECT1INFO">- <SPANCLASS="authorinitials">TOR</SPAN>, <SPANCLASS="authorinitials">JP</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf1_14.htm"TITLE="Acknowledgments for the Second Edition "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: Acknowledgments for the Second Edition "BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="UNIX Power Tools"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="UNIX Power Tools"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_02.htm"TITLE="1.2 Who Listens to What You Type?
