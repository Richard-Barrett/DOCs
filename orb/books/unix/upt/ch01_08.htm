With UNIX,your command interpreter is just another program. Traditionally,a command interpreter is called a &quot;shell,&quot; perhaps because itprotects you from the underlying kernel&nbsp;- or because it protectsthe kernel from you!</P><PCLASS="para">Several different shells are available: you are free to choose the onethat best suits your interests or your application. The most commonones are:</P><DLCLASS="variablelist"><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">sh</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1059"></A>The Bourne shell (named after its creator, Steve Bourne).This is the oldest of the current UNIX shells and isavailable on most UNIX systems.(Some systems have replaced <EMCLASS="emphasis">sh</EM> with a newer shell, like <EMCLASS="emphasis">ksh</EM> or<EMCLASS="emphasis">bash</EM>, that has the features of <EMCLASS="emphasis">sh</EM> and more.)It is a bit primitive and lacksjob control features (the ability to move jobs from the foreground tothe background).Most UNIX users considerthe Bourne shell superior for shell programming or writingcommand files.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">csh</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1070"></A>The C shell. It was developed at Berkeley as part of their UNIXimplementation and has been by far the most popular shell for interactive use.You will occasionally find a System V UNIX where the C shell isn'tavailable, but this is very rare. It has a lot of nice features thataren't available in the Bourne shell, including<SPANCLASS="link">job control (<ACLASS="linkend"HREF="ch12_08.htm"TITLE="Job Control in a Nutshell ">12.8</A>)</SPAN>and<SPANCLASS="link">history (<ACLASS="linkend"HREF="ch11_02.htm"TITLE="History in a Nutshell ">11.2</A>)</SPAN>(the ability to repeat commands that you have already given).However, while youwon't have trouble with normal usage,it isn't hard for a shell programmer to push the C shell to<SPANCLASS="link">its limits (<ACLASS="linkend"HREF="ch47_02.htm"TITLE="C Shell Programming Considered Harmful ">47.2</A>)</SPAN>.There are a lot of hidden bugs.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">ksh</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1080"></A>The Korn shell (also named after its creator, David Korn).The Korn shell iscompatible with the Bourne shell, but has most of the C shell'sfeatures plus some completely new features, like<SPANCLASS="link">history editing (<ACLASS="linkend"HREF="ch11_13.htm"TITLE="Shell Command-Line Editing ">11.13</A>)</SPAN>:theability to recall old commands and edit them before executing them. Itis also more reliable than <EMCLASS="emphasis">csh</EM>.The Korn shell is a standard part of UNIXSystem&nbsp;V Release&nbsp;4; it has also been included in some other UNIX implementions.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">bash</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1089"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1091"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1094"></A>The &quot;Bourne-again&quot; shell developed by the<SPANCLASS="link">Free Software Foundation (<ACLASS="linkend"HREF="glossary.htm#UPT-ART-1010"TITLE="Glossary">52.9</A>)</SPAN>.<SPANCLASS="link"><EMCLASS="emphasis">bash</EM> (<ACLASS="linkend"HREF="ch08_02.htm"TITLE="Introduction to bash">8.2</A>)</SPAN>is fairly similar to the Korn shell.It has many ofthe C shell's features, plus history editing and a built-in help command.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><EMCLASS="emphasis">tcsh</EM></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para"><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1104"></A>You may run into some extended versions of the C shell like <EMCLASS="emphasis">tcsh</EM>.<SPANCLASS="link"><EMCLASS="emphasis">tcsh</EM> (<ACLASS="linkend"HREF="ch08_03.htm"TITLE="Introduction to tcsh">8.3</A>)</SPAN>works like the original C shell&nbsp;- but with more features, and fewer mis-features.</P></DD></DL><PCLASS="para">There are also a fewthird-party shells that serve special purposes, like emulating the<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1110"></A><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-1113"></A>VAX/VMS command language (DCL). I don't know if there is aDOS-lookalike shell available, but there probably is. Why you wouldwant it is another question: all of the standard UNIX shells do a lotmore than the DOS command interpreter. Furthermore, I like todiscourage UNIX users from pretending that UNIX is something else.You are going to be spending a lot of time using UNIX: you will bebetter off learning it properly than trying to make it look like someother operating system.</P><PCLASS="para">In this book, we'll stick to the C shell and <EMCLASS="emphasis">bash</EM> for interactive use.Because <EMCLASS="emphasis">bash</EM> and <EMCLASS="emphasis">ksh</EM> can read scripts written for theoriginal Bourne shell, we use <EMCLASS="emphasis">sh</EM> for shell programming.</P><PCLASS="para">Where we talk about &quot;the Bourne Shell&quot; or <EMCLASS="emphasis">sh</EM>, it's usually a safe betthat the information applies to <EMCLASS="emphasis">bash</EM> and <EMCLASS="emphasis">ksh</EM> too.In the same way, &quot;the C shell&quot; generally also means <EMCLASS="emphasis">tcsh</EM>-and, insome cases, <EMCLASS="emphasis">bash</EM> as well.Just because <EMCLASS="emphasis">bash</EM>, <EMCLASS="emphasis">ksh</EM> and <EMCLASS="emphasis">tcsh</EM> have the features ofthe shells they came from, though, it isn't safe to assume that theirfeatures are in the original <EMCLASS="emphasis">csh</EM> or <EMCLASS="emphasis">sh</EM> too.</P><PCLASS="para">If you're new to UNIX, don't worry about keeping track of all these shells.In this book, we talk mostly about the C and Bourne shells.Those two shell &quot;styles&quot; are all you really need to know at the start.Later, you can learn and appreciate what's been added to <EMCLASS="emphasis">ksh</EM>,<EMCLASS="emphasis">tcsh</EM>, and <EMCLASS="emphasis">bash</EM>.</P><DIVCLASS="sect1info"><PCLASS="SECT1INFO">- <SPANCLASS="authorinitials">ML</SPAN>, <SPANCLASS="authorinitials">JP</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_07.htm"TITLE="1.7 Power Grows on You "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 1.7 Power Grows on You "BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="UNIX Power Tools"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="UNIX Power Tools"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch01_09.htm"TITLE="1.9 Which Shell Am I Running?
