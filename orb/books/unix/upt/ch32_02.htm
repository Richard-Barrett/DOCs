You can edit a different file in each window or readmail in one window, answer mail in another, issue shell commands in athird, and so on.Now that we all have nice workstations with mice and other crawlythings for navigating around a bitmapped screen, why do you care?First, you may not have a bitmapped screen, and even if you have onein the office, you may not at home. Second, Istill find Emacs preferable to most &quot;modern&quot; window systems because I<ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35827"></A>don't have to use a mouse. If I want to create another window, I justtype <CODECLASS="literal">CTRL-x</CODE>&nbsp;<CODECLASS="literal">2</CODE> (which splits the current window, whatever it is,into two); if I want to work in another window, I just type<CODECLASS="literal">CTRL-x</CODE>&nbsp;<CODECLASS="literal">o</CODE>; if I want to delete a window, I type <CODECLASS="literal">CTRL-x</CODE>&nbsp;<CODECLASS="literal">0</CODE>.Is this faster than reaching for my mouse and moving it around? Youbet. Particularly since my mouse is hidden under a pile of paper.(Of course, it's hidden because I hardly ever need it.) Once you'vecreated a window, it's just as easy to start editing a new file,initiate a shell session, and so on.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Shells</B></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">You can start an interactive shell within any Emacswindow; just type <CODECLASS="literal">ESC&nbsp;x&nbsp;shell</CODE>, and you'll see yourfamiliar shell prompt. It's easy to see why thisis so useful. It's trivial to return to earlier comands, copy them,and edit them. Even more important, you can easily take the output ofa command and copy it into a text file that you're editing&nbsp;- obviouslyan extremely useful feature when you're writing a book like this.Emacs also lets you issue commands that operate on the contents ofa window or a selected region within a window.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Keyboard Macros</B></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Emacs lets you define &quot;keyboard macros,&quot; sequences of commands thatcan be executed automatically. This is similar to <EMCLASS="emphasis">vi</EM>'s<SPANCLASS="link"><EMCLASS="emphasis">map</EM> (<ACLASS="linkend"HREF="ch31_02.htm"TITLE="Save Time and Typing with the vi map Commands ">31.2</A>)</SPAN>facility, with one extra twist: Emacs actually executes thecommands while you're defining the macro, while <EMCLASS="emphasis">vi</EM> expects youto figure out what you need to do, type it in without any feedback,and hope that the macro doesn't do anything hostile when you edit it.With Emacs, it's much easier to get the macro right. You can see whatit's going to do as you're defining it, and if you make a mistake, youcan correct it immediately.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Editing Modes</B></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Emacs has a large number of special editing &quot;modes&quot; that provide&quot;context sensitive&quot; help while you're writing. For example, if you'rewriting a C program, the C mode will help you to observe conventionsfor indentation and commenting. It automatically lines up braces for you, and tells you when parentheses are unbalanced.There are special modes for virtually every programming language I've ever heard of. There are alsospecial modes for HTML, <EMCLASS="emphasis">troff</EM>, TeX, outlines, stick figures, etc.</P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Mail</B></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Although I often use Emacs' mail facility as an example, I'm notpersonally fond of it. However, if you really like working withinthe Emacs environment, you should try it. </P></DD><DTCLASS="term"><BCLASS="emphasis.bold">Customization</B></DT><DDCLASS="listitem"><PCLASS="para">Emacs is the most customizable tool I've ever seen. Customization isbased on the LISP programming language, so you need to learn some LISPbefore you can work with it much. However, once you know LISP, youcan do virtually anything. For example, I have no doubt that youcould write a complete spreadsheet program within Emacs&nbsp;- which meansthat you could use your normal Emacs commands to edit the spreadsheet and incorporate it (in whole or in part) into your documents.(An Emacs-based spreadsheet may already exist, though I'm not aware of it.)And, because of the<SPANCLASS="link">FSF's (<ACLASS="linkend"HREF="glossary.htm#UPT-ART-1010"TITLE="Glossary">52.9</A>)</SPAN>General Public License,virtually all special-purpose packages are available for free.  </P></DD></DL><ACLASS="indexterm"NAME="AUTOID-35868"></A><DIVCLASS="sect1info"><PCLASS="SECT1INFO">- <SPANCLASS="authorinitials">ML</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch32_01.htm"TITLE="32.1 Emacs: The Other Editor "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: 32.1 Emacs: The Other Editor "BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="UNIX Power Tools"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="UNIX Power Tools"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="ch32_03.htm"TITLE="32.3 Customizations and How to Avoid Them "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: 32.3 Customizations and How to Avoid Them "BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">32.1 Emacs: The Other Editor </TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">32.3 Customizations and How to Avoid Them </TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><IMGSRC="../gifs/smnavbar.gif"USEMAP="#map"BORDER="0"ALT="The UNIX CD Bookshelf Navigation"><MAPNAME="map"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="0,0,73,21"HREF="../index.htm"ALT="The UNIX CD Bookshelf"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="74,0,163,21"HREF="index.htm"ALT="UNIX Power Tools"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="164,0,257,21"HREF="../unixnut/index.htm"ALT="UNIX in a Nutshell"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="258,0,321,21"HREF="../vi/index.htm"ALT="Learning the vi Editor"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="322,0,378,21"HREF="../sedawk/index.htm"ALT="sed &amp; awk"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="379,0,438,21"HREF="../ksh/index.htm"ALT="Learning the Korn Shell"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="439,0,514,21"HREF="../lrnunix/index.htm"ALT="Learning the UNIX Operating System"></MAP></DIV></BODY></HTML>
