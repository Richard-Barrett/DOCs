As the technicalbook buyer at Golden-Lee, a major book distributor, hediscovered us soon after we started publishing NutshellHandbooks in the mid-'80s. He was one of our early boosters,and we owed him one. So when he became an editor at Bantam (whosecomputer book publishing operations were later acquired by Random House), wetook him seriously when he started asking if there was anythingwe could do together.</P><PCLASS="para">At first nothing seemed to fit, since by that time we were doing prettywell as a publisher. We needed to find something that we could dotogether that might sell better than something that either company mightdo alone. Eventually, Ron suggested that we co-publish a UNIX book forBantam's &quot;Power Tools&quot; series. This made sense for both of us. Itgave Bantam access to our UNIX expertise and reputation, and gave us achance to learn from Bantam about the mass market bookstore trade, aswell as build on their successful &quot;Power Tools&quot; series.</P><PCLASS="para">But what would the book contain?There were two features of Bantam'soriginal <EMCLASS="emphasis">DOS Power Tools</EM> that we decided to emulate:  itsin-depth treatment of under-documented system features, and its largecollection of freely available scripts and utilities. However, we didn'twant to write yet another book that duplicated the format of manyothers on the market, in which chapters on each of the major UNIX toolsfollow one another in predictable succession. Our goal was certainly toprovide essential technical information on UNIX utilities, but moreimportantly, to show how the utilities can be combined and used to solvecommon (and uncommon) problems.</P><PCLASS="para">Similarly, because we were weary of the multitude of endlessly tutorialbooks about UNIX utilities, we wanted to keep the tone brisk and to thepoint. The solution I came up with, a kind of &quot;hypertext in print,&quot;actually owes a lot to Dale Dougherty. Dale has been working forseveral years on hypertext and online information delivery, and I wastrying to get him to work with me on this project. So I tried to imaginethe kind of book that he might like to create. (We have a kind offriendly rivalry, in which we try to leapfrog each other with ideas fornew and better books!)Dale's involvement never went farbeyond the early brainstorming stage, but the book still bears his indirectstamp. In some of the first books he wrote for me, he introduced the idea that sidebars-asides that illuminate and expandon the topic under discussion-could be used effectively ina technical book. Well, Dale, here's a bookthat's nothing but sidebars!</P><PCLASS="para">Dale, Mike Loukides, and I worked out the basic outline for the bookin a week or two of brainstorming and mail exchanges. We thought weshould be able to throw it together pretty quickly by mining many ofour existing books for the tips and tricks buried in them.Unfortunately, none of us was ever able to find enough time, and thebook looked to be dying a slow death. (Mike was the only one whogot any writing done.)Steve Talbott rescued the project byinsisting that it was just too good an idea to let go; he recruitedJerry Peek, who had just joined the company as a writer and UNIX consultant/tools developer for our productiondepartment.</P><PCLASS="para">Production lost the resulting tug of war, and Jerry plunged in. Jerryhas forgotten more UNIX tips and tricks than Mike, Dale, or I ever knew;he fleshed out our outline and spent a solid year writing andcollecting the bulk of the book. I sat back in amazement and delightas Jerry made my ideas take shape. Finally, though, Jerry had hadenough. The book was just too big and he'd never signed on to do itall alone! (It was about 1000 pages at that point, and only halfdone.) Jerry, Mike, and I spent a week locked up in our conference room,refining the outline, writing and cutting articles, and generallytrying to make Jerry feel a little less like Sisyphus.</P><PCLASS="para">From that point on, Jerry continued to carry the ball, but not quitealone, with Mike and I playing &quot;tag team,&quot; writing and editing to fillin gaps. I'm especially grateful to Mike for pitching in, since hehad many other books to edit and this was supposed to be &quot;my&quot; project.I am continually amazed by the breadth of Mike's knowledge and hisknack for putting important concepts in perspective.</P><PCLASS="para">Toward the end of the project, Linda Mui finished up another bookshe was working on and joined the project, documenting many of thefreely available utilities that we'd planned to include but hadn'tgotten around to writing up.Linda, you really saved us at the end!</P><PCLASS="para">Thanks also to all the other authors, who allowed us to use (andsometimes abuse!) their material. In particular, we're grateful toBruce Barnett, who let us use so much of what he's written, eventhough we haven't yet published his book, and ChrisTorek, who let us use many of the gems he's posted to the Net over the years.(Chris didn't keep copies of most of these articles; they were savedand sent in by Usenet readers, includingDan Duval,Kurt J. Lidl, andJarkko Hietaniemi.)</P><PCLASS="para">Jonathan Kamens and Tom Christiansen not only contributed articlesbut read parts of the book with learned and critical eyes. Theysaved us from many a &quot;power goof.&quot;If we'd been able to give them enough time to read the whole thing, we wouldn't have to issue the standard disclaimer that any errors that remain are our own.H. Milton Peek provided technical review and proofreading.Four sharp-eyed Usenet readers helped with debugging:Casper Dik of the University of Amsterdam,Byron Ratzikis of Network Appliance Corporation,Dave Barr of the Population Research Institute, andDuncan Sinclair.</P><PCLASS="para">In addition to allthe acknowledged contributors, there are many unacknowledgedones-people who have posted questions or answers to the Net over theyears, and who have helped to build the rich texture of the UNIXculture that we've tried to reflect in this book.Jerry also singles out one major contributor to his own mastery ofUNIX. He says:  &quot;Daniel Romike of Tektronix, Inc. (who wrote articles<ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch09_06.htm"TITLE="String Editing (Colon) Operators ">Section 9.6</A>and<ACLASS="xref"HREF="ch11_07.htm"TITLE="History Substitutions ">Section 11.7</A>in the early 1980s, by the way) led the first UNIX workshop I attended.He took the time to answer a ton of questions as I taught myselfUNIX in the early 1980s.I'm sure some of the insights and neat tricks that I thought I'vefigured out myself actually came from Dan instead.&quot;</P><PCLASS="para">James Revell and Bryan Buus scoured &quot;the Net&quot; for useful and interesting freesoftware that we weren't aware of. Bryan also compiled most of thesoftware he collected so we could try it out and gradually winnowdown the list.</P><PCLASS="para">Thanks also to all of the authors of the software packages we wroteabout and included on the disk! Without their efforts, we wouldn'thave had anything to write about; without their generosity in makingtheir software free in the first place, we wouldn't be able todistribute hundreds of megabytes of software for the price of a book.</P><PCLASS="para">Jeff Moskow of Ready-to-Run Software solved the problem we had beenputting off to the end, of packaging up all the software for thedisk, porting it to the major UNIX platforms, and making it easy toinstall. This was a much bigger job than we'd anticipated, and wecould never have done it without Jeff and the RTR staff. We mighthave been able to distribute source code and binaries for a fewplatforms, but without their porting expertise, we could never haveported all these programs to every supported platform.Eric Pearce worked with RTR to pre-master the software for CD-ROMduplication, wrote the installation instructions, and made sure thateverything came together at the end!(Eric, thanks for pitching inat the last minute.You were right that there were a lot of detailsthat might fall through the cracks.)</P><PCLASS="para">Edie Freedman worked with us to design the format of the book-quitean achievement considering everything we wanted the format to do!She met the challenge of presenting thousands of inline cross referenceswithout distracting the reader or creating a visual monstrosity.What she created is as attractive as it is useful-a realbreakthrough in technical book design, and one that we plan to useagain and again!  </P><PCLASS="para">Lenny Muellner was given the frightful task of implementing all ofour ideas in <EMCLASS="emphasis">troff</EM>&nbsp;- no mean feat, and one that added to hisstore of grey hair.</P><PCLASS="para">Eileen Kramer was the copyeditor, proofreader, and critic who made sure that everything came together. For athousand-plus page book with multiple authors, it's hard to imaginejust how much work that was.</P><PCLASS="para">Ellie Cutler wrote the index; Chris Reilley created theillustrations. Additional administrative support was provided byBonnie Hyland, Donna Woonteiler, and Jane Appleyard.</P><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis">&nbsp;- Tim O'Reilly</EM></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf1_12.htm"TITLE="Request for Comments "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: Request for Comments "BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="UNIX Power Tools"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="UNIX Power Tools"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf1_14.htm"TITLE="Acknowledgments for the Second Edition "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtnexta.gif"ALT="Next: Acknowledgments for the Second Edition "BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">Request for Comments </TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="index"HREF="index/idx_0.htm"TITLE="Book Index"><IMGSRC="../gifs/index.gif"ALT="Book Index"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172">Acknowledgments for the Second Edition </TD></TR></TABLE><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><IMGSRC="../gifs/smnavbar.gif"USEMAP="#map"BORDER="0"ALT="The UNIX CD Bookshelf Navigation"><MAPNAME="map"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="0,0,73,21"HREF="../index.htm"ALT="The UNIX CD Bookshelf"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="74,0,163,21"HREF="index.htm"ALT="UNIX Power Tools"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="164,0,257,21"HREF="../unixnut/index.htm"ALT="UNIX in a Nutshell"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="258,0,321,21"HREF="../vi/index.htm"ALT="Learning the vi Editor"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="322,0,378,21"HREF="../sedawk/index.htm"ALT="sed &amp; awk"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="379,0,438,21"HREF="../ksh/index.htm"ALT="Learning the Korn Shell"><AREASHAPE="RECT"COORDS="439,0,514,21"HREF="../lrnunix/index.htm"ALT="Learning the UNIX Operating System"></MAP></DIV></BODY></HTML>
