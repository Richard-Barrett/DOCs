Frank Willison,O'Reilly's Editor-in-Chief, fit this project into thesummer between leaving myposition at ORA and starting school.  Frank didn't just give mesomething to do in the summer: the royalties should help to pay for mycoursework.  (So, buy this book and support a student! <CODECLASS="literal">;-)</CODE>)Gigi Estabrook edited this edition and fielded my zillions ofquestions along the way.  Many thanks to Gigi, Frank, and ORA'sProduction staff. Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary and Nancy Wolfe Kotaryshared the jobs of production editor and project manager. MadeleineNewell and Kismet McDonough-Chan provided production support. SherylAvruch, Nicole Gipson Arigo, and Danny Marcus provided quality controlchecks. Lenny Muellner provided extensive <EMCLASS="emphasis">troff</EM> assistance andtechnical support. Chris Reilley created the technicalillustrations.</P><PCLASS="para">When time was short, I got expert advice from Arnold Robbins, themaintainer of the GNU <EMCLASS="emphasis">gawk</EM> utility, and co-author ofO'Reilly's <EMCLASS="emphasis">sed &amp; awk</EM>, second edition.  He reviewed parts of thebook and gave me thorough comments.</P><PCLASS="para">I'd also like to thank all the readers who took a moment to send uscomments and corrections.  I read every message, and the ideas in themmade a big difference in this second edition.  Three peoples' commentswere extensive enough to mention specially.  Ted Timar spottedproblems that showed his deep knowledge of UNIX.  I'm glad hestill found the book useful enough to read it-and to spot goofs insome of our hairier tips.  Andrew T. Young sent two long emailmessages: one a few years ago and another after I contacted him.  Hecaught plenty of techno-goofs and also sent fixes for them.  Andydoesn't know just UNIX: his background in English helped tosharpen a few rough spots in our folksy writing style.  Finally, GregUbben sent a 15-page (!) email message that took me most of a week towork through.  When I tracked him down, three years after writing hismessage, he was even more helpful.  Greg wrote enough to make into asmall book-and, in fact, agreed to write a few new articles, too.He's an expert in <EMCLASS="emphasis">sed</EM> and regular expressions (and UNIX)who taught me a lot in our month of email messages back and forth.  Ideeply appreciate all that he's given to this book's readers.</P><PCLASS="para"><EMCLASS="emphasis">&nbsp;- Jerry Peek, jpeek@jpeek.com</EM></P></DIV><DIVCLASS="htmlnav"><P></P><HRALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH="515"TITLE="footer"><TABLEWIDTH="515"BORDER="0"CELLSPACING="0"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TDALIGN="LEFT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="SECT1"HREF="prf1_13.htm"TITLE="Acknowledgments "><IMGSRC="../gifs/txtpreva.gif"ALT="Previous: Acknowledgments "BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="CENTER"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="171"><ACLASS="book"HREF="index.htm"TITLE="UNIX Power Tools"><IMGSRC="../gifs/txthome.gif"ALT="UNIX Power Tools"BORDER="0"></A></TD><TDALIGN="RIGHT"VALIGN="TOP"WIDTH="172"><ACLASS="CHAPTER"HREF="ch01_01.htm"TITLE="1.
