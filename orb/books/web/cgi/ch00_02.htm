CGI involves programming, so I expectyou to be comfortable thinking like a programmer. I don't expectyou to know any particular language, but you must promise that whenI show you a loop, you won't be thrown for a loop. I want this bookto be chock full of unique CGI techniques that you won't find elsewhere,and therefore I don't want to take up space telling you things thatyou can find in many other books.<P CLASS=para>The language of choice for CGI programming is Perl, at leaston UNIX systems. I also talk a little about severalother languages, notably Tcl. But most examples are in Perl. Still,I don't expect to force you into being a Perl programmer. I tryto describe everything I do carefully in plain English, so you canimplement the same techniques in the language of your choice. Remember,the main thing to learn is the concept; the way you implement itis up to you.<P CLASS=para>If you do come to the same conclusion that thousands of CGIprogrammers have reached-that Perl is the easiest language in whichto do the text and array manipulation that characterizes CGI tasks-thenyou can use my examples as a basis for your own Perl programs, andsupplement the book with either the extensive manual pages or thebooks on Perl from O'Reilly &amp; Associates:<I CLASS=emphasis> LearningPerl</I> by Randal Schwartz as a beginning tutorial and <I CLASS=emphasis>ProgrammingPerl</I> by Larry Wall and Randal Schwartz for advanced techniques.Perl is available on many non-UNIX systems, bythe way.<P CLASS=para>I should admit up front that there's a UNIXbias in this book, because UNIX is the most popularsystem for Web servers. Some of the things I do all the time onUNIX-such as pipe output to another program-haveto be done differently on other systems. And similarly, some ofthe security concerns that go along with executing UNIXcommands won't exist on other systems. But I repeat: The basic CGItasks are the same in any language, on any system. They spring fromthe division of labor between client and server, and the protocolsthey use to communicate.</DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch00_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch00_03.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>What's in the Book</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Organization of This Book</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
