Of course, we laughed it off several minutes later.<P CLASS=para>But, the idea never left either one of us. Several days later,we started writing up a contract, and the rest is history-thanksto Adrian Nye, an editor at O'Reilly, who helped us put the contracttogether. It was a dream come true: writing a technical book forO'Reilly &amp; Associates.<P CLASS=para>First and foremost, I'd like to thank Mr. Le for not onlysuggesting the idea for the book, but giving me an opportunity todevelop software straight out of high school. In addition, I'd liketo thank Rita Horsey, my other boss, who also taught me quite abit, and provided me with an Internet connection in the early daysof the book.<P CLASS=para>Of course, I'd also like to thank my family for not only puttingup with my bizarre work hours during the entire writing period,but also coming to my assistance whenever I needed it. There's noway I could have finished this book without their support.<P CLASS=para>Thanks to all the reviewers and everyone who provided suggestions:Jeffrey Friedl (the king of regular expressions), Andreas Koenig(the father of MakeMaker), Marc Hedlund (the originator of the CGIFAQ), Tom Christiansen (the UNIX wizard), JonBackstrom, Joseph Radin, Paul DuBois, and from ORA, Norman Walsh,Paula Ferguson, Ellie Cutler, Tanya Herlick, Frank Willison, AndyOram, Linda Mui (more on these guys in a minute), and Tim O'Reilly(the godfather of the Nutshell).<P CLASS=para>I had the privilege of working with two really excellent teachers,Andy and Linda, whom I also consider my friends. They've guidedme through the entire process, and their editorial criticisms werealways right on. So I'd like to thank them for everything.<P CLASS=para>Unfortunately, Andy has been through some very tough and tryingtimes in the last several months after an auto accident. No doubt,he'll be back to doing what he does best in no time! Get well soon,Andy. I also can't believe the amount of time Linda has devotedto the book, despite going through the trials and tribulations ofpregnancy. You guys are great!<P CLASS=para>Of course, a great big thanks go out to the production staffat ORA, especially Jane Ellin, who has done a great job managingthe production responsibilities, with help from Mike Sierra, KismetMcDonough, Mary Ann Faughnan, Sheryl Avruch, Sue Willing, HannaDyer, and Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary. Thanks to Chris Reilley forall the great figures, Edie Freedman for designing the cover (whichI wasn't happy with originally, but have come to love!), Seth Maislinfor the index, and Nancy Priest for the internal design.<P CLASS=para>And last, but not least, a thanks to all my friends here andto my family and relatives in India, especially my grandparents.<P CLASS=para>Hope you find the book useful!</DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch00_04.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Conventions in This Book</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>The Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
