Let's take a lookat some of the possible applications that can be designed usingCGI.<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="CGI-CHP-1-SECT-2.1">Forms</A></h3><P CLASS=para>One ofthe most prominent uses of CGI is in processing forms. Forms area subset of HTML that allow the user to supplyinformation. The forms interface makes Web browsing an interactiveprocess for the user and the provider. <A HREF="ch01_02.htm#CGI-CHP-1-FIG-2">Figure 1.2</A> shows a simpleform.<DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="CGI-CHP-1-FIG-2">Figure 1-2: Simple form illustrating different widgets</A></h4><p><img align=middle src="./figs/cgi0102.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 1-2]" width=474 height=468></DIV><P CLASS=para>As can be seen from the figure, a numberof graphical widgets are available for form creation, such as radiobuttons, text fields, checkboxes, and selection lists. When theform is completed by the user, the Submit Order! button is usedto send the information to the server, which executes the programassociated with the particular form to "decode" the data.<P CLASS=para>Generally,forms are used for two main purposes. At their simplest, forms canbe used to collect information from the user. But they can alsobe used in a more complex manner to provide back-and-forth interaction.For example, the user can be presented with a form listing the variousdocuments available on the server, as well as an option to searchfor particular information within these documents. A CGI programcan process this information and return document(s) that match theuser's selection criteria.<P CLASS=para><A HREF="ch04_01.htm">Chapter 4, <i>Forms and CGI</i></A>, discusses forms in detail, and <A HREF="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, <i>Advanced Form Applications</i></A>, shows examples of incorporating forms intoseveral robust applications.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="CGI-CHP-1-SECT-2.2">Gateways</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Web gateways are programsor scripts used to access information that is not directly readableby the client. For example, say you have an Oracle database thatcontains baseball statistics for all the players on your companyteam and you would like to provide this information on the Web.How would you do it? You certainly cannot point your client to thedatabase file (i.e., open the URL associated with the file) andexpect to see any meaningful data.<P CLASS=para>CGI provides a solutionto the problem in the form of a gateway. You can use a languagesuch as <i CLASS=filename>oraperl</i> (see Chapter 9, Gateways, Databases,and Search/Index Utilities, for more information) or a DBI extensionto Perl to form SQL queries to read the information contained withinthe database. Once you have the information, you can format andsend it to the client. In this case, the CGI program serves as agateway to the Oracle database, as shown in <A HREF="ch01_02.htm#CGI-CHP-1-FIG-3">Figure 1.3</A>.<DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="CGI-CHP-1-FIG-3">Figure 1-3: A gateway to a database</A></h4><p><img align=middle src="./figs/cgi0103.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 1-3]" width=502 height=303></DIV><P CLASS=para>Similarly, you can write gateway programsto any other Internet information service, including Archie, WAIS,and NNTP (Usenet News). <A HREF="ch10_01.htm">Chapter 10, <i>Gateways to Internet Information Servers</i></A>, showsexamples of interacting with other Internet services. In addition,you can amplify the power of gateways by using the forms interfaceto request a query or search string from the user to retrieve anddisplay <I CLASS=emphasis>dynamic</I>, or <I CLASS=emphasis>virtual,</I>information. We will discuss these special documents next.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="CGI-CHP-1-SECT-2.3">Virtual Documents</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Virtual, ordynamic, document creation is at the heart of CGI. Virtual documentsare created on the fly in response to a user's information request.You can create virtual HTML, plain text, image,and even audio documents. A simple example of a virtual documentcould be something as trivial as this:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>Welcome to Shishir's WWW Server!You are visiting from diamond.com. The load average on this machine is 1.25.Happy navigating!</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>Inthis example, there are two pieces of dynamic information: the alphanumericaddress (IP name) of the remote user and the load average on theserving machine. This is a very simple example, indeed!<P CLASS=para>Onthe other hand, very complex virtual documents can be created bywriting programs that utilize a combination of graphics libraries,gateways, and forms. As a more sophisticated example, say you arethe manager of an art gallery that specializes in selling replicasof ancient Renaissance paintings and you are interested in presentingimages of these masterpieces on the Web. You start out by creatinga form that asks for user information for the purpose of promotionalmailings, presents a search field for the user to enter the nameof a painting, as well as a selection list containing popular paintings.Once the user submits the form to the server, a program can emailthe user information to a certain address, or store it in a file.And depending on the user's selection, either a message statingthat the painting does not exist or an image of the painting canbe displayed along with some historical information located elsewhereon the Internet.<P CLASS=para>Along with the picture and history,another form with several image processing options to modify thebrightness, contrast, and/or size of the picture can be displayed.You can write another CGI program to modify the image propertieson the fly using certain graphics libraries, such as <I CLASS=emphasis>gd</I>,sending the resultant picture to the client.<P CLASS=para>This isan example of a more complex CGI program utilizing many aspectsof CGI programming. Several such examples will be presented in thisbook.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch01_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_03.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>What Is CGI?</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Some Working CGI Applications</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
