Because of theway the server operates-storing information in variables-it cannotbe designed to handle multiple connections simultaneously. Let'slook at the reason for this.<P CLASS=para>In UNIX, a process (parent) has the abilityto create another process (child) that executes some given codeindependently. This can be really useful for programs that needa lot of time to finish. For example, if you have a CGI programthat needs to calculate some complex equation, search large databases,or delete and clean-up a lot of files, you can "spawn" a child processthat performs the task, while the parent returns control to thebrowser. In such a case, the user does not have to wait for thetask to finish, because the child process is running in the background.Let's look at a simple CGI program:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>#!/usr/local/bin/perl$| = 1;print "Content-type: text/plain", "\n\n";print "We are about to create the child!", "\n";if ($pid = fork) {        print &lt;&lt;End_of_Parent;I am the parent speaking. I have successfully created a child process.The Process Identification Number (PID) of the child process is: $pid.The child will be cleaning up all the files in the directory. It mighttake a while, but you do not have to wait!End_of_Parent } else {        close (STDOUT);                system ("/usr/bin/rm", "-fr", "/tmp/CGI_test", "/var/tmp/CGI");        exit(0);}print "I am the parent again! Now it is time to exit.", "\n";print "My child process will work on its own! Good Bye!", "\n";exit(0);</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>The <I CLASS=emphasis>fork</I>command actually creates a child process, and returns the PID ofthe process to the parent, and a value of zero to the child. Inthis example, the first block of code is executed by the parent,while the second block is executed by the child. The one thing youhave to note is that the child process gets a copy of all the variablesand subroutines that are available to the parent. However, if thechild process makes any modifications at all, they are simply discardedwhen it exits; they do not affect the parent process.<P CLASS=para>This is the main reason why the cookie server cannot handlemultiple connections. There are two issues here. The first is thatmultiple connections are not supported. Once the CGI program connectsto the server, the server handles requests from the program, andso cannot accept any more connections until the program breaks theconnection. The only way to allow multiple connections is to forka process every time there is a connection, so there is a new processto handle each connection.<P CLASS=para>This leads us to the second issue. If there is a separatechild process to handle each connection, then each process wouldhave its own variable <I CLASS=emphasis>namespace</I> (along witha copy of the parent's data). If a child process modifies or storesnew data (in variables), then that data is gone once the processterminates, and there is no way to pass that data back to the parent.That's why we only have one server that keeps track of the dataone connection at a time.<P CLASS=para>The <I CLASS=emphasis>system</I> command that we have beenusing to execute UNIX commands is implementedin the following way:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>unless (fork) {    exec ("command");}wait;</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>This is identical to:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>system ("command");</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>Basically, the child process-the unless block executes onlyif the return value from fork is zero-executes the specified command,while the parent waits for it to finish. Here is how we could implementa server that handles multiple connections simultaneously (althoughthis approach will not work for our cookie server):<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>$SIG{'CHLD'} = "wait_for_child_to_die";while (1) {    ( ($ip_name, $ip_address) = &amp;accept_connection (COOKIE, SOCKET) )        || die "Could not accept connection.", "\n";        if (fork) {        #        # Parent Process (do almost nothing here)        #    } else {        #        # Child Process (do almost everything here)        #    }    &amp;close_connection (COOKIE);    }sub wait_for_child_to_die{    wait;}</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>One important note: If a parent does not wait for a childprocess to die, certain "zombie" processes will be left on the system.</DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch10_09.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch11_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Maintaining State with a Server</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Advanced and Creative CGI Applications</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
