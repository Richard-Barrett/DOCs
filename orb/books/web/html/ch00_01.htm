Most students first immerse themselves inexamples. Think how adept you'd become if Mom, Dad, your brothers, andsisters all spoke fluent HTML. Studying others is anatural way to learn, making learning easy and fun. Our advice toanyone wanting to learn HTML is to get out there onthe World Wide Web with a suitable browser and see for yourself whatlooks good, what's effective, what works for you. Examine others'HTML source files and ponder thepossibilities. Mimicry is how many of the current webmasters havelearned the language.<P CLASS=para>Imitation can take you only so far, though. Examples can be both goodand bad. Learning by example will help you talk the talk, but not walkthe walk. To become truly conversant, you must learn how to use thelanguage well and how to use the language appropriately in manydifferent situations. You could learn that by example, if you livelong enough.<P CLASS=para>Remember, too, that computer-based languages are more explicitthan human languages. You've got to get the HTMLsyntax correct, or it won't work. Then, too, there is the problemof ``standards.'' Committees of academics and industryexperts try to define the proper syntax and usage of a computerlanguage like HTML. The problem is thatHTML browser manufacturers like Netscape and Spyglass choose what parts of the standard theywill use and which parts they'll ignore. They even make up their ownparts, which may eventually become standards.<P CLASS=para>To be safe, the better way to become HTML fluent isthrough a comprehensive language reference: a resource that covers thelanguage syntax, semantics, and variations in detail, and helps youdistinguish between good and bad usage.<P CLASS=para>There's one more step leading to fluency in a language. To become atrue master of HTML, you need to develop your ownstyle. That means knowing what's not only appropriate, but what iseffective. Layout matters. A lot. So does the order of presentationwithin a document, between documents, and between documentcollections.<P CLASS=para>Our goal in writing this book is to help you become fluent inHTML, fully versed in the language's syntax,semantics, and elements of style. We take the natural learningapproach with examples: good ones, of course. We cover everyelement of the currently accepted version (2.0)[1]  of the language indetail, as well as many of the so-called ``extensions''the popular HTML browsers support, explaining howeach element works and how it interacts with all the other elements.<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[1] Contrary to popular misbelief, there is no HTMLversion 3.0. See "Is HTML 3.2 Really a Big Deal?" later inthis Preface.</blockquote><P CLASS=para>And, with all due respect to Strunk and White, throughout the book wegive you suggestions for style and composition to help you decide howbest to use the language and accomplish a variety of tasks, fromsimple online documentation to complex marketing and salespresentations. We'll show you what works and what doesn't; what makessense to those who view your pages, and what might be confusing.<P CLASS=para>In short, this book is a complete guide to creating documents usingHTML, starting with basic syntax and semantics, andfinishing with broad style directions that should help you createbeautiful, informative, accessible documents you'll be proud todeliver to your browsers.</DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>&nbsp;</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch00_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>&nbsp;</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Our Audience</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
