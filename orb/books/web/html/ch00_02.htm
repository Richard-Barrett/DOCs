We don't expect you to have any experience in thelanguage before picking up this book. In fact, we don't even expectthat you've ever used the World Wide Web, although we'd be surprisedif you haven't at least experimented with this technology. Beingconnected to the Internet is not necessary to use this book, but ifyou're not connected, this book becomes like a travel guide for thehomebound.<P CLASS=para>The only things we ask you to have are a computer, a text editorthat can create simple ASCII text files, and aWorld Wide Web browser like Netscape, Mosaic, or Internet Explorer foryour computer: the very latest version, if possible. BecauseHTML is stored in a universally acceptedformat--ASCII text--and because thelanguage is completely independent of any specific computer, we won'teven make an assumption about the kind of computer you'reusing. However, browsers do vary by platform and operating system, whichmeans your HTML documents can and often do lookquite different depending on the computer and version of browser. Wewill explain how certain language features are used by various popularbrowsers as we go through the book, so don't be surprised if yourbrowser gets mentioned here or there.<P CLASS=para>If you are new to HTML, the World Wide Web, orhypertext documentation in general, you should start by reading <A HREF="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, <i>HTML and the World Wide Web</i></A>. This chapter describes how all thesetechnologies come together to create webs of interrelated documents.<P CLASS=para>If you are already familiar with the Web, but notHTML specifically, or if you are interested in thenew features in HTML, start by reading <A HREF="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, <i>HTML Quick Start</i></A>. This chapter is a brief overview of themost important features of the language and serves as a roadmap to howwe approach the language in the remainder of the book.<P CLASS=para>Subsequent chapters deal with specific language features in a roughlytop-down approach to the HTML. Read them in order for a completetour through the language, or jump around to find the exact featureyou're interested in.</DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch00_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch00_03.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Our Function</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Text Conventions</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
