Folks, HTML 3.2 doesn'tshake any Web foundations. In fact, the new language standard simplyconfirms what most Web observers have known for some time now, thatNetscape Communications is the tail wagging the HTMLstandards dog.<P CLASS=para>Until about mid-1995, people actually were serious aboutHTML standards. (Some of us still are.) Until then,standards guided the development of new browsers. After release ofHTML 2.0, however, the elders of the World Wide WebConsortium (W3C) responsible for such language-standardsmatters lost control.  The abortive HTML+ standard nevergot off the ground, and HTML 3.0 became sobogged down in debate that the W3C simply shelved the entiredraft standard.<P CLASS=para>What mired the development of new language standards was NetscapeNavigator. Most Web analysts agree that Netscape's quick success inbecoming the browser of choice for an overwhelming majority of users can beattributed directly to the company's implementation of useful and excitingadditions to HTML. Today, all other browsermanufacturers, including the behemoth Microsoft Corp. who appreciates themeaning of ``de facto standard'' better than anyone in the business,have to implement Netscape's HTML extensions if theyexpect to have any chance of competing in the Web browser marketplace. Bypushing the W3C to officially release HTML standardversion 3.2, which for all intents and purposes standardizes most of Netscape'slanguage extensions, the other browser manufacturers gain legitimacy fortheir products without having to acknowledge the leading competitor.Internet Explorer can now be ``HTML3.2-compliant,'' rather than submissively ``NetscapeNavigator-compliant.''<P CLASS=para>The paradox is that the HTML 3.2 standard is<I CLASS=emphasis>not</I> the definitive resource. There are many morefeatures of the language in popular use than are included in this latestlanguage standard.<P CLASS=para>This book, on the other hand, is the definitive guide toHTML. We give details for all the elements of theHTML 2.0 standard, the elements of the proposedHTML 3.2 standard, plus the variety of interestingand useful extensions to the language that popular browsermanufacturers have chosen to include in their products, such as:Frames, Inline multimedia, Dynamic documents, Java, Text font size and face controls, and <P CLASS=para>And while we tell you about each and every feature of the language,standard or not, we also tell you which browsers or different versions ofthe same browser implement a particular extension and which don't. That'scritical knowledge when you want to create Web pages that take advantage ofthe latest version of Netscape Navigator versus pages that are accessible tothe larger number of people usingInternet Explorer, Mosaic, or even Lynx, a popular text-onlybrowser for UNIX systems.<P CLASS=para>In addition, there are a few things that are closely related but not directlypart of HTML. We touch, but do not handle, for example,CGI and Java programming. CGI andJava programs work closely with HTML documents and runwith or alongside browsers, but are not part of the language itself, and sowe don't delve into them. Besides, they are comprehensive topics thatdeserve their own books, such as <I CLASS=emphasis>Java in a Nutshell</I>and <I CLASS=emphasis>CGI Programming on the World Wide Web</I> fromO'Reilly &amp; Associates, for instance.<P CLASS=para>In short, this book is your definitive guide to HTML asit is and should be used, including every extension we could find. Manyaren't documented anywhere, even in the plethora of online guides. But, ifwe've missed anything, certainly let us know and we'll put it in the nextedition.</DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch00_03.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch00_05.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Text Conventions</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Acknowledgments</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
