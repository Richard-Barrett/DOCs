Our wives Jeanne and Cindy(with whom we've just become reacquainted) and our young children Eva,Ethan, Courtney, and Cole (they happened <I CLASS=emphasis>before</I>we started writing) formed the front lines of support. And there arenumerous neighbors, friends, and colleagues who helped by sharingideas, testing browsers, and letting us use their equipment to exploreHTML. You know who you are, and we thank youall. (Ed Bond, we'll be over soon to repair your Windows.)<P CLASS=para>We also thank our technical reviewers, Kane Scarlett, Eric Raymond,and Chris Tacy, for carefully scrutinizing our work. We took most ofyour keen suggestions. And we especially thank Mike Loukides, oureditor, who had to bring to bear his vast experience in bookpublishing to keep us two mavericks corralled.<P CLASS=para>And, finally, we thank the many people at O'Reilly &amp; Associates whopoked our words into sensibility and put them onto these pages. Thesefolks include: Mary Anne Weeks Mayo, project manager/copyeditor forthe book; Len Muellner, Ellen Siever, and Erik Ray converted the bookfrom Word for Windows to SGML and contributed theirtool-tweaking prowess; Chris Reilley created the excellent figures;Edie Freedman designed the cover; Nancy Priest designed the interiorlayout; Hanna Dyer designed the back cover; Seth Maislin prepared theindex; and Sheryl Avruch, Clairemarie Fisher O'Leary, and Kismet McDonoughChan did the final quality control on the book.</DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch00_04.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Is HTML 3.2 Really a Big Deal?</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>HTML and the World Wide Web</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
