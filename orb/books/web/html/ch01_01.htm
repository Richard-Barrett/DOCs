Today, you can bump intoInternet users of nearly any and all nationalities, of any and allpersuasions, from serious to frivolous individuals, from businesses tononprofit organizations, and from born-again evangelists topornographers.<P CLASS=para>In many ways, the World Wide Web--the open community ofhypertext-enabled document servers and readers on theInternet--is responsible for the meteoric rise in the network'spopularity. You, too, can become a valued member by contributing:writing HTML documents and making them available toWeb ``surfers'' worldwide.<P CLASS=para>Let's climb up the Internet family tree to gain some deeper insightinto its magnificence, not only as an exercise of curiosity, but tohelp us better understand just who and what it is we are dealing withwhen we go online.<DIV CLASS=sect1><h2 CLASS=sect1><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-1">1.1 The Internet</A></h2><P CLASS=para><A NAME="CH01.INTERNET"></A>Although popular media accounts often are confused and confusing, theconcept of the <I CLASS=emphasis>Internet</I> really is rather simple.It's a collection of networks--a network of networks--computerssharing digital information via a common set of networking andsoftware protocols. Nearly anyone can connect their computer to theInternet and immediately communicate with other computers and users on theNet.<P CLASS=para>What is confusing about the Internet is that it can be like anoriental bazaar: It's not well organized, there are few contentguides, and it can take a lot of time and technical expertise to tapits full potential.<P CLASS=para>That's because...<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-1.1">In the Beginning</A></h3><P CLASS=para><A NAME="CH01.INTERNET.HISTORY"></A><A NAME="CH01.HISTORY"></A>The Internet began in the late 1960s as an experiment in the design ofrobust computer networks. The goal was to construct a network ofcomputers that could withstand the loss of several machines withoutcompromising the ability of the remaining ones to communicate. Fundingcame from the U.S. Department of Defense, which had a vestedinterest in building information networks that could withstand nuclearattack.<P CLASS=para>The resulting network was a marvelous technical success, but waslimited in size and scope. For the most part, only defense contractorsand academic institutions could gain access to what was then known asthe ARPAnet (Advanced Research Projects Agencynetwork of the Department of Defense).<P CLASS=para>With the advent of high-speed modems for digital communication overcommon phone lines, some individuals and organizations not directlytied to the main digital pipelines began connecting and takingadvantage of the network's advanced and globalcommunications. Nonetheless, it wasn't until these last few years(around 1993, actually) that the Internet really took off.<P CLASS=para>Several crucial events led to the meteoric rise in popularity of theInternet. First, in the early 1990s, businesses and individuals eagerto take advantage of the ease and power of global digitalcommunications finally pressured the largest computer networks on themostly U.S. government-funded Internet to open their systems for nearlyunrestricted traffic. (Remember, the network wasn't designed to routeinformation based on content--meaning commercial messages wentthrough university computers that at the time forbade such activity.)<P CLASS=para>True to their academic traditions of free exchange and sharing, manyof the original Internet members continued to make substantialportions of their electronic collections of documents and softwareavailable to the newcomers--free for the taking! Globalcommunications, a wealth of free software and information: whocould resist?<P CLASS=para>Well, frankly, the Internet was a tough row to hoe back then. Gettingconnected and using the various software tools, if they were evenavailable for their computers, presented an insurmountable technologybarrier for most people. And, too, most available information wasplain-vanilla ASCII about academic subjects, notthe neatly packaged fare that attracts users to the online services,such as America Online, Prodigy, or CompuServe. The Internet was justtoo disorganized and, outside of the government and academia, fewpeople had the knowledge or interest to learn how to use the arcanesoftware or had the time to spend rummaging throughdocuments looking for ones of interest.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-1.2">HTML and the World Wide Web</A></h3><P CLASS=para><A NAME="CH01.WWW.HISTORY"></A><A NAME="CH01.HISTORY.WWW"></A>It took another spark to light the Internet rocket. At about the sametime the Internet opened up for business, some physicists atCERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory,released an authoring language and distribution system they developedfor creating and sharing multimedia-enabled, integrated electronicdocuments over the Internet. And so was born <I CLASS=emphasis>HyperTextMarkup Language</I>(<I CLASS=emphasis>HTML</I>), browser software, andthe World Wide Web. No longer did authors have to distribute theirwork as fragmented collections of pictures, sounds, andtext. HTML unified those elements. Moreover, theWorld Wide Web's systems enabled <I CLASS=emphasis>hypertextlinking</I> wherein documents automatically reference otherdocuments, located anywhere around the world: less rummaging, moreproductive time online.<P CLASS=para>Lift-off happened when some bright students and faculty at theNational Center for Supercomputing Applications(NCSA) at the University of Illinois,Urbana/Champaign, wrote a Web browser calledMosaic. Although designed primarily for viewingHTML documents, the software also had built-intools to access the much more prolific resources on the Internet, suchas FTP archives of software and Gopher-organizedcollections of documents.<P CLASS=para>With versions based on easy-to-use graphical-user interfaces familiarto most computer owners, Mosaic became an instant success. It,like most Internet software, was available on the Net forfree.[1] Millions of users snatched up a copy and began surfing the Internetfor ``cool Web pages.''<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[1] Not all browsers are free, nor are all browsers free to everyone. Thevarious client browser and server software are commerciallyavailable, including documentation and support. Internet``bundled'' software sold through mail order or retail oftencontains a licensed copy of one of the popular browsers like Mosaic orNetscape, possibly customized for the package. Moreover, the browsersavailable for download over the Internet typically contain licensingagreements which stipulate that the software is free only for use bynon-profit organizations.</blockquote></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-1.3">Golden Threads</A></h3><P CLASS=para>There you have the history of the Internet and the World Wide Web in anutshell: from rags to riches in just two short years. The Internethas spawned an entirely new medium for worldwide information exchangeand commerce, and its pioneers are profiting well. For instance, whenthe marketeers caught on to the fact that they could cheaply produceand deliver eye-catching, wow-and-whizbang commercials and productcatalogs to those millions of Web surfers around the world, there wasno stopping the stampede of blue suede shoes. Even the key developersof Mosaic and related Web server technologies sensed potential riches.They left NCSA and formed Netscape Communicationsto produce the Netscape Navigator browser and Webserver software that is useful for Internetcommercial activity.<P CLASS=para>Business users and marketing opportunities have helped invigorate theInternet and fuel its phenomenal growth, particularly on the WorldWide Web. According to a recent marketing survey by<I CLASS=emphasis>Activ</I>Media, Inc. (Peterborough, NH), over half ofInternet enterprises become profitable within a year of launch! Butdo not forget that the Internet is first and foremost a place forsocial interaction and information sharing, not a strip mall or directadvertising medium. Internet users, particularly the old-timers, adhereto commonly held, but not formally codified, rules of<I CLASS=emphasis>netiquette</I> that prohibit such things as``spamming'' special-interest newsgroups with messagesunrelated to the topic at hand or sending unsolicited email. And thereare millions of users ready to remind you of those rules should youinadvertently or intentionally ignore them.<P CLASS=para>And, certainly, the power of HTML and networkdistribution of information go well beyond marketeering and monetaryrewards: serious informational pursuits also benefit. Publications,complete with images and other media like executable software, can getto their intended audience in a blink of an eye, instead of the monthstraditionally required for printing and mail delivery. Education takesa great leap forward when students gain access to the great librariesof the world. And at times of leisure, the interactive capabilities ofHTML links can reinvigorate our otherwisetelevision-numbed minds.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch00_05.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Acknowledgments</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Talking the Internet Talk</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
