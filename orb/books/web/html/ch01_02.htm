An<I CLASS=emphasis>IP address</I> is made up of four numbers, each lessthan 255, joined together by periods, such as 192.12.248.73 or131.58.97.254.<P CLASS=para>While computers only deal in numbers, people prefer names. For thisreason, each computer on the Internet also has a name bestowed upon itby its owner. There are several million machines on the Net, so it'dbe very difficult to come up with that many unique names, let alonekeep track of them all. Recall, though, that the Internet is a networkof networks. It is divided into groups known as<I CLASS=emphasis>domains</I>, which are further divided into one ormore <I CLASS=emphasis>subdomains.</I> So, while you might choose avery common name for your computer, it becomes unique when you append,like surnames, all of the machine's domain names as a period-separatedsuffix, creating a <I CLASS=emphasis>fully qualified </I>domain name.<P CLASS=para>This naming stuff is easier than it sounds. For example, the fullyqualified domain name ``www.ora.com'' translates to amachine named ``www'' that's part of the domain known as``ora,'' which, in turn, is part of the commercial(com) branch of the Internet. Other branches of theInternet include educational (edu) institutions, nonprofitorganizations (org), U.S. government (gov), and Internet serviceproviders (net). Computers and networks outside the United States havea two-letter abbreviation at the end of their names: for example,``ca'' for Canada, ``jp''for Japan, and ``uk'' for the United Kingdom.<P CLASS=para>Special computers, known as <I CLASS=emphasis>name servers</I>, keeptables of machine names and their associated unique IP numericaladdresses, and translate one into the other for us and for ourmachines. Domain names must be registered with the nonprofit organizationInterNIC. Once registered, the owner of the domainname broadcasts it and its address to other domain name servers(DNS) around the world. Each domain and subdomainhas an associated name server, so ultimately every machine is knownuniquely by both a name and an IP address.<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-2.1">Clients, Servers, and Browsers</A></h3><P CLASS=para>The Internet connects two kinds of computers:<I CLASS=emphasis>servers</I>, which serve up documents, and<I CLASS=emphasis>clients</I>, which retrieve and display documents forus humans. Things that happen on the server machine are said to be onthe <I CLASS=emphasis>server side</I>, while activities on the clientmachine occur <I CLASS=emphasis>client side</I>.<P CLASS=para>To access and display HTML documents, we runprograms called <I CLASS=emphasis>browsers</I> on our clientcomputers. These browser clients talk to special <I CLASS=emphasis>Webservers</I> over the Internet to access and retrieve electronicdocuments.<P CLASS=para>Several Web browsers are available--most are free--eachoffering a different set of features. For example, browsers like Lynxrun on character-based clients and display documents only astext. Others run on clients with graphical displays and renderdocuments using proportional fonts and color graphics on a 1024x768,24-bit-per-pixel display. Others still--Netscape Navigator,Mosaic, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, WebCruiser from Netcom,InterCon's NetShark, and Hot Java from Sun Microsystems, to name afew--have special features that allow you to retrieve and displaya variety of electronic documents over the Internet, including audioand movie multimedia.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-2.2">The Flow of Information</A></h3><P CLASS=para>All Web activity begins on the client side, when a user starts theirbrowser. The browser begins by loading a <I CLASS=emphasis>homepage</I> HTML document from either localstorage or from a server over some network, such as the Internet. Inthe latter case, the client browser first consults a domain nameserver to translate the home page document server's name, likewww.ora.com, into an IPaddress, before sending a request to that server over theInternet. This request (and the server's reply) is formatted accordingto the dictates of the <I CLASS=emphasis>HyperText Transfer Protocol(HTTP)</I> standard.<P CLASS=para>A server spends most of its time listening to the Internet, waitingfor document requests with the server's unique address stamped onit. Upon receipt, the server verifies that the requesting browser isallowed to retrieve documents from the server and, if so, checks forthe requested document. If found, the server sends (downloads) thedocument to the browser. The server usually logs the request, theclient computer's name, document requested, and the time.<P CLASS=para>Back on the browser, the document arrives. If it's a plain-vanillaASCII text file, most browsers display it in acommon, plain-vanilla way. Document directories, too, are treated likeplain documents, although most graphical browsers will display foldericons, which the user can select with the mouse to downloadthe contents of subdirectories.<P CLASS=para>Browsers also retrieve binary files from a server. Unless assisted bya <I CLASS=emphasis>helper</I> program or specially enabled by<I CLASS=emphasis>plug-in</I> software or <I CLASS=emphasis>applets</I>,which display an image file or play an audio file, thebrowser usually stores downloaded binary files directly on a local diskfor later attention by the user.<P CLASS=para>For the most part, however, the browser retrieves a special documentthat appears to be a plain text file, but contains both text andspecial markup codes called <I CLASS=emphasis>tags.</I> The browserprocesses these HTML documents, formatting the textbased upon the tags and downloading special accessory files, such asimages.<P CLASS=para>The user reads the document, selects a hyperlink to another document,and the entire process starts over.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-2.3">Beneath the World Wide Web</A></h3><P CLASS=para>We should point out at this juncture that browsers and HTTP serversneed not be part of the Internet's World Wide Web to function. Infact, you never need to be connected to the Internet, or to anynetwork for that matter, to write HTML documentsand operate a browser. You can load up and display on your clientbrowser locally stored HTML documents and accessoryfiles directly. This isolation is good: it gives you the opportunityto finish, in the editorial sense of the word, a document collectionfor later distribution. Diligent HTML authors worklocally to write and proof their documents before releasing them forgeneral distribution, thereby sparing readers the agonies of brokenimage files and bogus hyperlinks.[2]<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[2] Vigorous testing of the HTML collection once it ismade available on the Web is, of course, also highly recommended andnecessary to rid it of various linking bugs.</blockquote><P CLASS=para> Organizations,too, can be connected to the Internet and the World Wide Web, but alsomaintain private Webs and HTML document collectionsfor distribution to clients on their local network, or<I CLASS=emphasis>Intranet</I>. In fact, private Webs are fast becomingthe technology of choice for the paperless offices we've heard so muchabout these last few years. With HTML documentcollections, businesses and other enterprises can maintain personneldatabases, complete with employee photographs and online handbooks,collections of blueprints, parts, and assembly manuals, and soon--all readily and easily accessed electronically by authorizedusers and displayed on a local computer.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch01_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_03.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>The Internet</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>HTML: What It Is</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
