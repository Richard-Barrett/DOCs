It defines the syntax and placementof special, embedded directions that aren't displayed by the browser,but tell it how to display the contents of the document,including text, images, and other support media. The language alsotells you how to make a document interactive through specialhypertext links, which connect your document with other documents inyours and others' collections, as well as with other Internet resources,like FTP and Gopher.<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-3.1">HTML Standards and Extensions</A></h3><P CLASS=para>The basic syntax and semantics of HTML are definedin the HTML standard, currently version2.0. HTML is a young language, barely three yearsold but already in its second iteration. Don't be too surprised ifanother version appears before you finish reading this book. Given thepace of these standards matters, one never knows when or if a newstandard version will come to fruition. While theHTML 3.0 standard has faded into oblivion, thestandards committee is working to collect some of the more popularbrowser extensions into an interim standard, known asHTML 3.2.  The draft of this standard should becomeavailable in July, 1996 and defines a base set of tags that almost allcurrent browsers support.<P CLASS=para>Browser developers rely upon the HTML standard toprogram the software that formats and displays commonHTML documents. Authors use the standard to makesure they are writing effective, correct HTMLdocuments. Nonetheless, commercial forces have pusheddevelopers to add into their browsers--Netscape Navigator andInternet Explorer, in particular--nonstandardextensions meant to improve the language. Many times, these extensionsare implementations of future standards still under debate. Extensionscan foretell future standards because so many people use them.<P CLASS=para>In this book, we explore in detail the syntax, semantics, and idiomsof HTML 2.0, along with the many importantextensions that are supported in the latest versions of the mostpopular browsers, so that any aspiring HTML authorcan create fabulous documents with a minimum of effort.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-3.2">Standards Organizations</A></h3><P CLASS=para><A NAME="CH01.STANDARDIZING"></A>Like many popular technologies, HTML started out asan informal specification used by only a few people. As more and moreauthors began to use the language, it became obvious that more formalmeans were needed to define and manage--to standardize--HTML'sfeatures, making it easier for everyone to create and sharedocuments.<DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-3.2.1">The World Wide Web Consortium</A></h4><P CLASS=para>The World Wide Web Consortium, aka W3C, was formed with the charter todefine the standard versions of HTML. Members areresponsible for drafting, circulating for review, and modifying thestandard based on cross-Internet feedback to best meet the needs ofthe many.<P CLASS=para>Beyond HTML, the W3C has the broader responsibilityof standardizing any technology related to the World Wide Web: theymanage the HTTP standard, as well as relatedstandards for document addressing on the Web. And they solicit draftstandards for extensions to existing Web technologies, such asinternationalization of the HTML standard.<P CLASS=para>If you want to track HTML's development and relatedtechnologies, contact the World Wide Web Consortium at <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</A>. Several Internetnewsgroups are devoted to the World Wide Web, each a part of thecomp.infosystems.wwwhierarchy. These include comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html andcomp.infosystems.www.authoring.images.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-3.2.2">The Internet Engineering Task Force</A></h4><P CLASS=para>Even broader in reach than W3C, the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) is responsible for defining and managingevery aspect of Internet technology. The World Wide Web is just onesmall part under the purview of the IETF.<P CLASS=para>The IETF defines all of the technology of theInternet via official documents known as Requests For Comment, orRFCs. Individually numbered for easy reference,each RFC addresses a specific Internettechnology--everything from the syntax of domain names and theallocation of IP addresses, to the format of electronic mail messages.<P CLASS=para>To learn more about the IETF and to follow theprogress of various RFCs as they are circulated forreview and revision, visit the IETF home page, at<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/">http://www.ietf.org/</A>.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch01_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_04.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Talking the Internet Talk</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>HTML: What It Isn't</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
