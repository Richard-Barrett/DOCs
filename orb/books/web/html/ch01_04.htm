That's because its fundamental purpose is to define thestructure and appearance of documents and document families so thatthey might be delivered quickly and easily to a user over a networkfor rendering on a variety of display devices. Jack of all trades, butmaster of none, so to speak.<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-4.1">Content Versus Appearance</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Before you can fully appreciate the power of the language and begincreating effective HTML documents, you mustyield to its one fundamental rule: HTML is designedto structure documents and make their content more accessible, not toformat documents for display purposes.<P CLASS=para>HTML does provide many different ways to let youdefine the appearance of your documents: font specifications, linebreaks, and preformatted text are all features ofHTML. And, of course, appearance is important sinceit can have either detrimental or beneficial effects on how usersaccess and use the information in your HTMLdocuments.<P CLASS=para>But with HTML, content is paramount; appearance issecondary, particularly since it is less predictable given the varietyof browser graphics and text-formatting capabilities. Besides,HTML contains many more ways for structuring yourdocument content without regard to the final appearance: sectionheaders, structured lists, paragraphs, rules, titles, and embeddedimages are all defined by HTML without regardfor how these elements might be rendered by a browser.<P CLASS=para>If you treat HTML as a document-generation tool,you will be sorely disappointed in your ability to format yourdocument in a specific way. There is simply not enough capabilitybuilt into HTML to allow you to create the kind ofdocuments you might whip up with tools like FrameMaker or MicrosoftWord. Attempts to subvert the supplied structuring elements to achievespecific formatting tricks seldom work across all browsers. In short,don't waste your time trying to force HTML to dothings it was never designed to do.<P CLASS=para>Instead, use HTML in the manner it was designedfor: indicating the structure of a document so that the browser canthen render its content appropriately. HTML is rifewith tags that let you indicate the semantics of your documentcontent, something that is missing from tools like Frame orWord. Create your documents using these tags and you'll be happier,your documents will look better, and your readers will benefitimmensely.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-4.2">Specific Limitations of HTML</A></h3><P CLASS=para>There are limits to the kinds of formatting and document structuringHTML can provide. Extensions to the language removesome of the restrictions imposed by HTML 2.0; otherlimitations linger.<P CLASS=para>Specifically, the features that do not exist in theHTML 2.0 standard but are made possible byextensions implemented by the various browser manufacturers, and aregenerally considered part of HTML 3.2, include:<P><UL CLASS=itemizedlist><li CLASS=listitem>Inline variation of font size<P><li CLASS=listitem>Mixed font attributes like bold and italic<P><li CLASS=listitem>Centered or right-justified text<P><li CLASS=listitem>Justifying images<P><li CLASS=listitem>Flowing text around figures and images<P><li CLASS=listitem>Tables<P></UL><P CLASS=para>Those niceties that just aren't available in any version ofHTML are:<P><UL CLASS=itemizedlist><li CLASS=listitem>Footnotes, end notes, automatic table of contents, or indices<P><li CLASS=listitem>Headers and footers<P><li CLASS=listitem>Tabs and other automatic character spacing<P><li CLASS=listitem>Nested numbered lists<P><li CLASS=listitem>Mathematical typesetting<P></UL></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-4.3">Yielding to the Browser</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Many novice HTML authors try to get around theselimitations by taking careful note of how their browser displays thecontents of certain tags and then misusing those tags to achieveformatting tricks. For example, some authors nest certain kinds oflists several levels deep, not because they are actually creatingdeeply nested lists, but because they want their text speciallyindented.<P CLASS=para>There are many different browsers running on many different computersand they all do things differently. Even two different users using thesame browser version on their machines can reconfigure the software sothat the same HTML document will look completelydifferent. What looks fabulous on your personal browser can and oftendoes look terrible on other browsers.<P CLASS=para>Yield to the browser. Let it format your document in whatever way itdeems best. Recognize that the browser's job is to present yourdocuments to the user in a consistent, usable way. Your job, in turn,is to use HTML effectively to mark up yourdocuments so that the browser can do its job effectively. Spend lesstime trying to achieve format-oriented goals. Instead, focus yourefforts on creating the actual document content and adding theHTML tags to structure that content effectively.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch01_03.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_05.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>HTML: What It Is</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Nonstandard Extensions</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
