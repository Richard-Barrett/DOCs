That's why Netscape Navigator is the mostpopular browser used on the Web today. While others were content toimplement HTML standards, the developers atNetscape were hard at work extending the language and their browser tocapture the potentially lucrative and certainly exciting commercialmarkets on the Web. In a year after going into business, Netscapecaptured over 70 percent of browser users.<P CLASS=para>With a market presence like that, Netscape leads not only the market,but the standards drive, as well. Those browser features that Netscapeprovides and that aren't part of HTML 2.0 or theproposed version 3.2 quickly become de facto standards because so manypeople use them. Consequently, Netscape is the browser otherdevelopers must emulate. For instance, Internet Explorer, developed incollaboration with Spyglass and bundled with Windows 95, adopts mostof Netscape's enhancements to HTML and has someembellishments of its own.<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-5.1">Extensions: Pro and Con</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Every software vendor adheres to the technological standards; it'sembarrassing to be incompatible and your competitors will take everyopportunity to remind buyers of your product's failure to comply, nomatter how arcane or useless that standard might be. At the same time,vendors seek to make their products different and better than thecompetition's offerings. Netscape's extensions to standardHTML are a perfect example of these marketpressures at work.<P CLASS=para>Many HTML document authors feel safe usingNetscape's nonstandard extensions, because of its commanding share ofusers. For better or worse, extensions to HTML madeby the folks at Netscape instantly become part of thestreet version of HTML, much like English slangcreeping into the vocabulary of most Frenchmen despite the bestefforts of the Academie Fran&ccedil;aise.<P CLASS=para>The reality, however, is that browsers are becoming less and lessstandard--de facto or not. The W3C isn't keeping up. And otherbrowser developers are not about to remain quiescent forlong. Netscape holds the commanding lead now, but everyone can hearthe heavy footsteps of such technology powerhouses as Sun Microsystemsand Microsoft heading toward the Internet and the Web. Increasingly,browser competitors are implementing many of the Netscape extensionsand adding a few of their own for good measure.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-5.2">Avoiding Extensions</A></h3><P CLASS=para>In general, we urge you to resist using an HTMLextension unless you have a compelling and overriding reason to doso. By using them, particularly in key portions of your documents, yourun the risk of losing a substantial portion of your potentialreadership. Sure, the Netscape community is large enough to make thispoint moot now, but even so you are excluding several million peoplewithout Netscape from viewing your pages.<P CLASS=para>Of course, there are varying degrees of dependency onHTML extensions. If you use some of the horizontalrule extensions, for example, most other browsers will ignore theextended attributes and render a conventional horizontal rule. On theother hand, reliance upon a number of font size changes and textalignment extensions to control your document appearance will makeyour document look terrible on many alternative browsers. It might noteven display at all on browsers that don't support the extensions.<P CLASS=para>We admit that it is a bit disingenuous of us to decry the use ofHTML extensions while presenting completedescriptions of their use. In keeping with the general philosophy ofthe Internet, we'll err on the side of handing out guns and rope toall interested parties while hoping you have enough smarts to keepfrom hanging yourself or shooting yourself in the foot.<P CLASS=para>Our advice still holds, though: only use an extension where it isnecessary or very advantageous, and do so with the understanding thatyou are disenfranchising a portion of your audience. To that end, youmight even consider providing separate, standards-based versions ofyour documents to accommodate users of other browsers.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-5.3">Beyond Extensions: Exploiting Bugs</A></h3><P CLASS=para>It is one thing to take advantage of an extension toHTML, and quite another to exploit known bugs in aparticular version of a browser to achieve some unusual documenteffect.<P CLASS=para>A good example is the multiple-body bug in version 1.1 of NetscapeNavigator. The HTML standard insists that anHTML document have exactly one<TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag, containing the body of the document. Thenow-obsolete browser allowed any number of <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT>tags, processing and rendering each <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> inturn. By placing several <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tags in anHTML document, an author could achieve crudeanimation effects when the document was first loaded into thebrowser. The most popular one had several <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT>tags, each with a slightly different background color. This trickresults in a document fade-in effect.<P CLASS=para>The party ended when version 1.2 of Netscape fixed the bug. Suddenly,thousands of documents lost their fancy fade-in effect. Although facedwith some rather fierce complaints, to their credit the people atNetscape stood by their decision to adhere to thestandard, placing compliance higher on their list of priorities thannifty rendering hacks.<P CLASS=para>In that light, we can unequivocally offer this advice:<I CLASS=emphasis>never</I> exploit a bug in a browser to achieve aparticular effect in your documents.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch01_04.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_06.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>HTML: What It Isn't</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Tools for the HTML Designer</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
