You also need, at least, a browser so you cantest and refine your work. Beyond the essentials are some softwaretools specialized for HTML document preparation andediting, and others for developing and preparing accessory multimediafiles.<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-6.1">Essentials</A></h3><P CLASS=para>At the very least, you'll need an editor, a browser to check yourwork, and ideally, a connection to the Internet.<DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-6.1.1">Word processor or HTML editor?</A></h4><P CLASS=para>Some authors use the word-processing capabilities of their specializedHTML editing software. Others, such as ourselves,prefer to compose their work on a general word processor and laterinsert the HTML tags and their attributes. Stillothers embed HTML tags as they compose.<P CLASS=para>We think the stepwise approach--compose, then mark up--isthe better way. Word processors typically have more and better writingtools, such as an outliner, spell-checker, and thesaurus, so you cancraft the document's flow and content well, disregarding for themoment its look. We find that once we've defined and written thedocument's content, it's much easier to make a second pass tojudiciously and effectively add the HTML tags toformat the text. Note, too, that, unless specially trained (if theycan be), spell-checkers and thesauruses typically choke onHTML markup tags and their various parameters. Youcan spend what seems to be a lifetime clicking the ignore button onall those otherwise valid markup tags when syntax- or spell-checkingan HTML document.<P CLASS=para>When and how you embed HTML tags into your documentdictate the tools you need. Some word processors, such as WordPerfector Microsoft Word, come with automated tools, and there arethird-party ones, too, that automatically translate yourword-processed documents into HTML. Don't expectmiracles, though. Except for boilerplate documents, you probably willneed to nurse those automated HTML documents tofull health.<P CLASS=para>Another word of caution about HTML editors: Not alladhere to the HTML 2.0 standard, so examine theirspecifications before using, and certainly before purchasing,one. Moreover, some of the WYSIWYG(what-you-see-is-what-you-get) HTML editors don'thave up-to-date built-in browsers, so they may erroneously decode theHTML tags and give you misleading displays.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-6.1.2">Browser software</A></h4><P CLASS=para>Obviously, you should view your newly composed HTMLdocuments and test their functionality before you release them for useby others. For serious HTML authors, particularlythose looking to push their documents beyond theHTML standards, we recommend that you have severalbrowser products, perhaps with versions running on differentcomputers, just to be sure one's delightful display isn't another'snightmare.<P CLASS=para>The currently popular, and so most important, browsers are NetscapeNavigator, Mosaic, and Internet Explorer. Sun's HotJava, althoughstill in alpha testing state, is expected by some to have a brightfuture. Obtain free copies of the software via anonymousFTP from their respective servers (ftp.netscape.com, ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, ftp.microsoft.com, and ftp.java.com), or contactyour local computer software dealer for a commercial version (about$50).</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-6.1.3">Internet connection</A></h4><P CLASS=para>We think you should have bona fide access to the Internet if you arereally serious about learning and honing your HTMLwriting skills. Okay, it's not absolutely essential since you cancompose and view HTML documents locally. And forsome, a connection is perhaps not even possible or practical, but makethe effort; there's sometimes no better way to learn than byexample. HTML examples abound on the Internet, bothgood and bad, whose source HTML you can downloadand examine.<P CLASS=para>Moreover, an Internet connection <I CLASS=emphasis>is</I> essential fordevelopment and testing if you include hypertext links to Internetservices in your HTML documents. But, most of all,an Internet connection gives you access to a wealth of tips andongoing updates to the language through special-interest newsgroups,as well as much of the essential and accessory software you can use toprepare HTML document collections.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH01-SECT-6.2">An Extended Toolkit</A></h3><P CLASS=para>If you're serious about creating documents, you'll soon findthere are all sorts of nifty tools that make life easier. The list offreeware, shareware, and commercial products grows daily, so it's notvery useful to provide a list here. This is, in fact, another goodreason why you should get an Internet connection; various groups keepupdated lists of HTML resources on the Web. If youare really dedicated to writing in HTML, you willvisit those sites, and you will visit them regularly to keep abreastof the language, tools, and trends.<P CLASS=para><A HREF="ch01_06.htm#USING-HTML-CH01-TAB-1">Table 1.1</A> summarizes the most usefulHTML author resources currently on the Web. Eachcontains dozens, sometimes hundreds, of hyperlinks to detaileddescriptions of products and other important information for theHTML author.
