Youprobably shouldn't either. HTML is simple to readand understand, and it's simple to write, too. So let's get startedwithout first learning a lot of arcane rules.<P CLASS=para>To help you get that quick, satisfying start, we've included thischapter as a brief summary of the many elements ofHTML. Of course, we've left out a lot of detailsand some tricks you should know.  Read the upcoming chapters toget the essentials for becoming fluent inHTML.<P CLASS=para>Even if you are familiar with HTML, we recommendyou work your way through this chapter before tackling the restof the book. It not only gives you a working grasp of basicHTML and its jargon, you'll also be moreproductive later, flush with the confidence that comes from creatingattractive documents in such a short time.<DIV CLASS=sect1><h2 CLASS=sect1><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH02-SECT-1">2.1 Writing Tools</A></h2><P CLASS=para>Use any text editor to create HTML documents, aslong as it can save your work on disk inASCII text file format. That's because, even thoughHTML documents include elaborate text layout andpictures, they're all just plain old ASCIIdocuments themselves. A fancier WYSIWYG editor oran HTML translator for your favorite word processorare fine, too--although they may not support the manynonstandard HTML features we discuss later in thisbook. You'll probably end up touching up the HTMLsource text they produce, as well.<P CLASS=para>While not needed to compose HTML, you should haveat least one version of a popular World Wide Web browser installed onyour computer to view your work, preferably Netscape Navigator,NCSA Mosaic, or Microsoft's InternetExplorer. That's because the HTML source documentyou compose on your text editor doesn't look anything like what getsdisplayed by a browser, even though it's the same document. Make surewhat your readers actually see is what you intended by viewing theHTML document yourself with a browser. Besides, thepopular ones are free over the Internet. If you can't retrieve abrowser copy yourself, get a friend to give you a copy.<P CLASS=para>Also note that you don't need a connection to the Internet or theWorld Wide Web to write and view your HTMLdocuments. You may compose and view your documents stored on a hard orfloppy disk that's attached to your computer. You can even navigateamong your local documents with HTML's hyperlinkingcapabilities without ever being connected to the Internet, or anyother network for that matter. In fact, we recommend that you worklocally to develop and thoroughly test your HTMLdocuments before you share them with others.<P CLASS=para>We strongly recommend, however, that you <I CLASS=emphasis>do</I> get aconnection to the Internet and to the World Wide Web if you areserious about composing your own HTMLdocuments. You may download and view others' interesting Web pages andsee how they accomplished some interesting feature--good orbad. Learning by example is fun, too. (Reusing others' work, on theother hand, is often questionable, if not downright illegal.) AnInternet connection is particularly essential if you include in yourwork hyperlinks to other documents on the Internet.</DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch01_06.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch02_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Word processor or HTML editor?</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>A First HTML Document</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
