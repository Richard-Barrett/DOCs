That's because HTMLemerged as a way to enrich the structure and organization of text.<P CLASS=para> HTML came out of academia. What wasand still is important to those early developers was the ability oftheir mostly academic, text-oriented documents to be scanned and readwithout sacrificing their ability to distribute documents over theInternet to a wide diversity of computer displayplatforms. (ASCII text is the only universal formaton the global Internet.) Multimedia integration is something of anappendage to HTML, albeit an important one.<P CLASS=para> And, too, page layout is secondary to structure inHTML. We humans visually scan and decide textualrelationships and structure based on how it looks; machines can onlyread encoded markings. Because HTML documents haveencoded tags that relate meaning, they lend themselves very well tocomputer-automated searches and recompilation of content--features very important to researchers. It's not so much<I CLASS=emphasis>how</I> something is said in HTMLas <I CLASS=emphasis>what</I> is being said.<P CLASS=para> Accordingly, HTML is not apage-layout language. In fact, given the diversity ofuser-customizable browsers as well as the diversity of computerplatforms for retrieval and display of electronic documents, allHTML strives to accomplish is<I CLASS=emphasis>advise,</I> not dictate, how the document might lookwhen rendered by the browser. You cannot force the browser to displayyour document in any certain way. You'll hurt your brain if you insistotherwise.<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH02-SECT-6.1">Appearance of Text</A></h3><P CLASS=para>For instance, you cannot predict what font and what absolutesize--8- or 40-point Helvetica, Geneva, Subway, orwhatever--will be used for a particular user's textdisplay. Users may change their browser fonts and some browsers aretext-only with no nice fonts at all.<P CLASS=para> Nonetheless, you can attach common style attributes toyour text with <I CLASS=emphasis>physical style</I> tags like theitalics <TT>&lt;i&gt;</TT> tag in the simple example. Moreimportantly and truer to the language's original intentions,HTML has <I CLASS=emphasis>content-based</I> styletags that attach <I CLASS=emphasis>meaning</I> to various text passages. All of today'sgraphical browsers recognize the physical and content-related textstyle tags and change the appearance of their related text passage tovisually convey meaning or structure. You just can't predict exactlywhat that change will look like.<DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch02-SECT3-AUTOID.1">Content-based text styles</A></h4><P CLASS=para>Content-based style tags indicate to the browser that a specificportion of your HTML text has a specific usage ormeaning. The <TT>&lt;cite&gt;</TT> tag in our simple example, forinstance, means the enclosed text is some sort of citation--thedocument's author, in this case. Browsers commonly, although notuniversally now or perhaps ever, display the citation text in italics,not as regular text. <I CLASS=emphasis>[content-based styles,<A HREF="ch04_03.htm#USING-HTML-CH04-SECT-3.1">4.3.1</A>]</I><P CLASS=para> While it may or may not be obvious to the current readerthat the text is a citation, someday, someone might create a computerprogram that searches a vast collection of HTMLdocuments for embedded <TT>&lt;cite&gt;</TT> tags and compiles aspecial list of citations from the enclosed text. Similar softwareagents already scour the Internet for HTML-embeddedinformation to compile listings, such as the infamous Webcrawler andthe Lycos Home Page databases of Web sites.<P CLASS=para> The most common content-based style used today is thatof emphasis, indicated with the <TT>&lt;em&gt;</TT> tag. And ifyou're feeling really emphatic, you might use the<TT>&lt;strong&gt;</TT> content style. Other content-based stylesinclude <TT>&lt;code&gt;</TT>, for snippets of programming code;<TT>&lt;kbd&gt;</TT>, to denote text entered by the user via akeyboard; <TT>&lt;samp&gt;</TT> to mark sample text;<TT>&lt;dfn&gt;</TT> for definitions; and <TT>&lt;var&gt;</TT> todelimit variable names within programming code samples. All of thesetags have corresponding end tags.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH02-SECT-6.1.1">Physical styles</A></h4><P CLASS=para>Even the barest of barebones text processors conform to a fewtraditional text styles, such as italicized and bold-facedcharacters. While HTML is not a word-processingtool in the traditional sense, it does provide tags that tell thebrowser explicitly to display (if it can) a character, word, or phrasein a particular physical style.<P CLASS=para> Although you should use related content-based tags forthe reasons we argue above, sometimes form is more important thanfunction. So, to italicize text, without imposing any specificmeaning, use the <TT>&lt;i&gt;</TT> tag; the <TT>&lt;b&gt;</TT>tag to display text in bold; or the <TT>&lt;tt&gt;</TT> tag so thatthe browser, if it can, displays the text in a teletypewriter-stylemonospaced typeface. <I CLASS=emphasis>[physical-based styles, <A HREF="ch04_03.htm#USING-HTML-CH04-SECT-3.2">4.3.2</A>]</I><P CLASS=para>It's easy to fall into the trap of using physical styles when youshould really be using a content-based style instead. Disciplineyourself now to use the content-based styles, because, as we argueabove, they convey meaning as well as style, thereby making yourdocuments easier to automate and manage.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch02-SECT3-AUTOID.2">Special text characters</A></h4><P CLASS=para>Not all text characters available to you for display by a browser canbe typed from the keyboard. And some characters have specialmeanings in HTML, such as the brackets around tags,which if not somehow differentiated when used for plain text--theless-than sign (&lt;) in a math equation, forexample--will confuse the browser and trash yourdocument. HTML gives you a way to include any ofthe many different characters that comprise theASCII character set anywhere in your text through aspecial encoding of its <I CLASS=emphasis>character entity</I>.<P CLASS=para> Like the copyright symbol in our simple example, acharacter entity starts with an ampersand (&amp;),followed by its name, and terminated with a semicolon. (Youalternatively may also use the character's positionnumber in the ASCII table of characters preceded bythe number symbol (#) in lieu of its name in thecharacter entity sequence.) When rendering the document, the browserdisplays the proper character, if it exists in the user'sfont.<I CLASS=emphasis> [character entities, <A HREF="ch03_04.htm#USING-HTML-CH03-SECT-4.2">3.4.2</A>]</I><P CLASS=para> For obvious reasons, the most commonly used characterentities are the greater-than (&amp;gt;), less-than (&amp;lt;), andampersand (&amp;amp;) characters. Check <A HREF="appd_01.htm">Appendix D, <i>Character Entities</i></A>, to find what symbol the character entity``&amp;#166;'' represents.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH02-SECT-6.2">Text Structures</A></h3><P CLASS=para>It's not obvious in our simple example, but the common carriagereturns we use to separate paragraphs in our source document have nomeaning in HTML, except in specialcircumstances. You could have typed the document onto a single line inyour text editor and it would still appear the same in <A HREF="ch02_02.htm#USING-HTML-CH02-FIG-1">Figure 2-1</A>![3]<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[3] We use a computer programming-like style of indentation so our sourceHTML documents are more readable. It's notobligatory, nor are there any formal style guidelines for sourceHTML document text formats. We do, however, highlyrecommend you adopt your own consistent style, so that you and otherscan easily follow your source documents.</blockquote><P CLASS=para> You'd soon discover, too, if you hadn't read it herefirst, that except in special cases, browsers typically ignore leadingand trailing spaces, and sometimes more than a few in between. (If youlook closely at the source example, the line ``Greetingsfrom'' looks like it should be indented by leading spaces, but itisn't in <A HREF="ch02_02.htm#USING-HTML-CH02-FIG-1">Figure 2-1</A>.)<DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch02-SECT3-AUTOID.3">Paragraphs and line breaks</A></h4><P CLASS=para>A browser takes the text in the body of your document and``flows'' it onto the computer screen, disregarding anycommon carriage-return or line-feed characters in the source. Thebrowser fills as much of each line of the display window as possible,beginning flush against the left margin, before stopping after therightmost word and moving on to the next line. Resize the browserwindow, and the text reflows to fill the new space; indicatingHTML's inherent flexibility.<P CLASS=para>Of course, readers would rebel if your text just ran onand on, so HTML does provide both explicit andimplicit ways to control the basic structure of your document. Themost rudimentary and common ways are with the paragraph(<TT>&lt;p&gt;</TT>) and the line-break (<TT>&lt;br&gt;</TT>)tags. Both break the text flow, which consequently restarts on a newline. The only apparent difference is that with most browsers, theparagraph tag adds more vertical space after the line break. <I CLASS=emphasis>[<TT>&lt;p&gt;</TT>, <A HREF="ch04_01.htm#USING-HTML-CH04-SECT-1.2">4.1.2</A>]</I> <I CLASS=emphasis>[<TT>&lt;br&gt;</TT>, <A HREF="ch04_07.htm#USING-HTML-CH04-SECT-7.1">4.7.1</A>]</I><P CLASS=para>By the way, the HTML standardincludes an end tag for the paragraph tag, but not for the line breaktag. Few authors ever include the paragraph end tag in theirdocuments;[4]the browser usually can figure out where one paragraph ends andanother begins. Give yourself a star if you knew that<TT>&lt;/p&gt;</TT> even exists.<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[4] The paragraph end tag is being used more commonly now that the popularbrowsers support the paragraph-alignment attribute.</blockquote></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch02-SECT3-AUTOID.4">Headings</A></h4><P CLASS=para>Besides breaking your text into paragraphs, you also can organize yourdocuments into sections with headings. Just as they do on this andother pages in this printed book, HTML headings notonly divide and entitle discrete passages of text, they also conveymeaning visually. With HTML, however, headings alsolend themselves to machine-automated analyses.<P CLASS=para> There are six HTML heading tags,<TT>&lt;h1&gt;</TT> through <TT>&lt;h6&gt;</TT>, withcorresponding end tags. Typically, the browser displays their contentsin respectively very large to very small font sizes, and sometimes inboldface. The text inside the <TT>&lt;h4&gt;</TT> tag is usually thesame size as the regular text. <I CLASS=emphasis>[headings, <A HREF="ch04_02.htm#USING-HTML-CH04-SECT-2">4.2</A>]</I><P CLASS=para> The heading tags also typically break the current textflow, standing alone on lines and separated from surrounding text,even though there aren't any explicit paragraph or line-break tagsbefore or after a heading.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch02-SECT3-AUTOID.5">Horizontal rules</A></h4><P CLASS=para>Besides headings, HTML also provides horizontalrule lines that help delineate and separate the sections of yourdocument.<P CLASS=para> When the browser encounters an <TT>&lt;hr&gt;</TT> tagin your document, it breaks the flow of text and draws a linecompletely across the display window on a new line. The flow of textresumes immediately below the rule. <I CLASS=emphasis>[<TT>&lt;hr&gt;</TT>, <A HREF="ch05_01.htm#USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-1.1">5.1.1</A>]</I></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch02-SECT3-AUTOID.6">Preformatted text</A></h4><P CLASS=para>Occasionally, you'll want the browser to display a block of text as-iswith, for example, indented lines and vertically aligned letters ornumbers that don't change even though the browser window might getresized. The HTML <TT>&lt;pre&gt;</TT> tag risesto those occasions. All text, up to the closing<TT>&lt;/pre&gt;</TT> end tag, appears in the browser window exactlyas you type it, including carriage returns and line feeds, leading,trailing, and intervening spaces. Although very useful for tables andforms, <TT>&lt;pre&gt;</TT> text turns out pretty dull; thepopular browsers render the block in a monospace typeface. <I CLASS=emphasis>[<TT>&lt;pre&gt;</TT>, <A HREF="ch04_07.htm#USING-HTML-CH04-SECT-7.5">4.7.5</A>]</I></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch02_05.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch02_07.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>The Flesh on an HTML Document</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Hyperlinks</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
