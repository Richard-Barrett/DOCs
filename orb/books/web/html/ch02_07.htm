Hypertext gives users the ability toretrieve and display a different document in your own or someoneelse's collection simply by a click of the mouse on an associated wordor phrase (<I CLASS=emphasis>hyperlink</I>) in yourHTML document. Use these interactive hyperlinks tohelp readers easily navigate and find information in yours and inothers' collections of otherwise separate documents in a variety offormats, including multimedia, HTML, and plainASCII text. Hyperlinks literally bring the wealthof knowledge on the whole Internet to the tip of the mouse pointer.<P CLASS=para> To include a hyperlink to some other document in yourown collection or on a server in Timbuktu, all you need to know is thedocument's unique address and how to drop an<I CLASS=emphasis>anchor</I> into your HTMLdocument. <I CLASS=emphasis>[anchors, <A HREF="ch02_07.htm#USING-HTML-CH02-SECT-7.2">2.7.2</A>]</I><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH02-SECT-7.1">URLs</A></h3><P CLASS=para>While it is hard to believe given the millions, perhaps billions, ofthem out there, every document and resource on the Internet has aunique address known as its universal resource locator(URL; commonly pronounced``you-are-ell''). A URL is comprised ofthe document's name preceded by the hierarchy of directory names inwhich the file is stored (<I CLASS=emphasis>pathname</I>), the Internet<I CLASS=emphasis>domain name</I> of the server that hosts the file,and the software and manner by which the browser and the document'shost server communicate to exchange the document(<I CLASS=emphasis>protocol</I>):<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><tt CLASS=replaceable><i>protocol://server domain name/pathname</i></tt></PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>Here are some sample URLs:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>http://www.kumquat.com/docs/catalog/price_list.hmtlhttp:price_list.htmlhttp://www.kumquat.com/ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>The first example is what's known as an <I CLASS=emphasis>absolute</I>or complete URL. It includes every part of theURL format--protocol, server, and the pathnameof the document.<P CLASS=para> While absolute URLs leave nothing tothe imagination, they can lead to big headaches when you movedocuments to another directory or server. Fortunately, browsers alsolet you use <I CLASS=emphasis>relative</I> URLs andautomatically fill in any missing portions with respective parts fromthe current document's <I CLASS=emphasis>base</I>URL. The second example is the simplest relativeURL of all; it assumes that the<i CLASS=filename>price_list.html</i> document is located on the sameserver and in the same directory as the current document.<P CLASS=para> Relative URLs are useful, too, if youdon't know a directory or document's name. The thirdURL example, for instance, points to kumquat.com's Web home page.<P CLASS=para>Although appearances may deceive, the lastFTP example URL actually isabsolute; it points directly at the contents of the<i CLASS=filename>/pub</i> directory.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH02-SECT-7.2">Anchors</A></h3><P CLASS=para>The anchor (<TT>&lt;a&gt;</TT>) tag is the HTMLfeature for defining both the source and the destination of ahyperlink.[5] You'll most often see and use the <TT>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tagwith its href attribute to definea source hyperlink. The value of the attribute is theURL of the destination.<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[5] The nomenclature here is a bit unfortunate: the ``anchor''tag should mark just a destination, not the jumping off point of ahyperlink, too. You ``drop anchor''; you don't jump offone. We won't even mention the atrociously confusing terminology theHTML standard uses for the various parts of ahyperlink except to say that someone got things all ``bassackwards.''</blockquote><P CLASS=para> The contents of the source <TT>&lt;a&gt;</TT>tag--the words and/or images between it and its<TT>&lt;/a&gt;</TT> end tag--is the portion of theHTML document that is specially activated in thebrowser display and that users select to take a hyperlink. These<I CLASS=emphasis>anchor</I> contents usually look different fromthe surrounding content (text in a different color or underlined,images with specially colored borders) and the mouse pointer iconchanges when passed over them. The <TT>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag contents,therefore, should be text or an image (icons are great) thatexplicitly or intuitively tells users where the hyperlink will takethem. <I CLASS=emphasis>[<TT>&lt;a&gt;</TT>, <A HREF="ch06_03.htm#USING-HTML-CH06-SECT-3.1">6.3.1</A>]</I><P CLASS=para> For instance, the browser will specially display andchange the mouse pointer when it passes over the ``KumquatArchive'' text in the following example:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>For more information on kumquats, visit our &lt;a href="http://www.kumquat.com/archive.html"&gt;Kumquat Archive&lt;/a&gt;</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>If the user clicks the mouse button on that text, the browserautomatically retrieves from the server www.kumquat.com a Web (http:) page stored there named<i CLASS=filename>archive.html</i>, and then displays it for the user.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH02-SECT-7.3">Hyperlink Names and Navigation</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Pointing to another document in some collection somewhere on the otherside of the world is not only cool, but it also supports your ownHTML documents. Yet the hyperlinks' chief duty is tohelp users navigate your collection in their search for valuableinformation. Hence, the concept of the home page and supportingHTML documents has arisen.<P CLASS=para> None of your HTML documents shouldrun on and on. First, there's the performance issue: the value of yourwork suffers, no matter how rich it is, if the document takes foreverto download, and if once retrieved, users must endlessly scroll up anddown through the display to find a particular section.<P CLASS=para>Rather, design your work as a collection of several compact andsuccinct pages, like chapters in a book, each focused to a particulartopic for quick selection and browsing by the user. Then usehyperlinks to organize that collection.<P CLASS=para>For instance, use your home page--the leading document of thecollection--as a master index full of brief descriptions andrespective hyperlinks to the rest of your collection. Also use thespecial attribute of the <TT>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag called name.<P CLASS=para> Anchors with the nameattribute serve as internal hyperlink targets in yourHTML documents. Normally, the browser displays afreshly downloaded document at the beginning. Name anchors let youbegin the display at the section of interest furtherdown. Simply include them anywhere they make sense as a hyperlinktarget. They do not change the appearance of enclosed or surroundingcontent.<P CLASS=para>Thereafter, you may append the name, after a separating hash mark(#), as a suffix in the URL of a hyperlink thatreferences that specific place in your document. For instance, toreference a specific topic in an archive, such as ``Kumquat StewRecipes'' in our example Kumquat Archive, you mark that sectionwith a name anchor:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>... preceding content... &lt;a name="Stews"&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Kumquat Stew Recipes"&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>In the same or another document, you prepare a source hyperlink that pointsdirectly to those recipes by including the section's anchor name as asuffix to the document's URL, separated by a hashmark (#):<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>For more information on kumquats, visit our &lt;a href="http://www.kumquat.com/archive.html"&gt;  Kumquat Archive&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps try one or two of our&lt;a href="http://www.kumquat.com/archive.html#Stews"&gt;   Kumquat Stew Recipes&lt;/a&gt;.</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>If selected by the user, the latter hyperlink causes the browser todownload the <i CLASS=filename>archive.html</i> document and start thedisplay at our ``Stew'' anchor.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH02-SECT-7.4">Anchors Beyond HTML</A></h3><P CLASS=para>HTML hyperlinks are not limited to otherHTML documents. Anchors let you point to nearly anytype of document available over the Internet, including other Internetservices.<P CLASS=para> However, ``let'' and ``enable'' aretwo different things. Browsers can manage the various Internetservices, like FTP and Gopher, so that users candownload non-HTML documents. They don't yet fullyor gracefully handle multimedia.<P CLASS=para> Today, there are few standards for the many types andformats of multimedia. Computer systems connected to the Web varywildly in their abilities to display those sound and videoformats. Except for some graphics images, standardHTML gives you no specific provision for display ofmultimedia documents except the ability to reference one in ananchor. The browser, which retrieves the multimedia document, mustactivate a special <I CLASS=emphasis>helper</I> application, downloadand execute an associated <I CLASS=emphasis>applet</I>, or have a<I CLASS=emphasis>plugin </I> accessory installed to decode and displayit for the user.<P CLASS=para> Although HTML and most Web browserscurrently avoid the confusion by sidestepping it, that doesn't meanyou can't or shouldn't exploit multimedia in yourHTML documents: just be aware of thelimitations.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch02_06.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch02_08.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>HTML and Text</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Images Are Special</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
