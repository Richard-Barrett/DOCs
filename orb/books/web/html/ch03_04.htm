Like tags, document content is encoded using a specificcharacter set, the ISO-8859-1 Latincharacter set, by default. This character set is a superset ofconventional ASCII, adding the necessary charactersto support the Western European languages. If your keyboard does notallow you to directly enter the characters you need, you can usecharacter entities to insert the desired characters.<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH03-SECT-4.1">Advice Versus Control</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Perhaps the hardest rule to remember when marking up anHTML document is that all the tags you insertregarding text display and formatting are only advice for the browser:they do not explicitly control how the browser will display thedocument. In fact, the browser can choose to ignore all of your tagsand do what it pleases with the document content. What's worse, theuser (of all people!) has control over text-display characteristics ofhis or her own browser. Imagine that.<P CLASS=para> Get used to this lack of control. The best way to useHTML markup to control the appearance of yourdocuments is to concentrate on the content of the document, not on itsfinal appearance. If you find yourself worrying excessively aboutspacing, alignment, text breaks, and character positioning, you'llsurely end up with ulcers. You will have gone beyond the intent ofHTML. If you focus on delivering information tousers in an attractive manner, using the tags to advise the browser asto how best to display that information, you are usingHTML effectively, and your documents will renderwell on a wide range of browsers.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH03-SECT-4.2">Character Entities</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Besides common text, HTML gives you a way todisplay special text characters you might not normally be able toinclude in your source document or which have other purposes inHTML. A good example is the less-than(&lt;) symbol. In HTML, it normallysignifies the start of a tag, so if you insert it simply as part ofyour text, the browser will get confused and probably misinterpretyour document.<P CLASS=para> In HTML, the ampersand(&amp;) character instructs the browser to insert aspecial character, formally known as a <I CLASS=emphasis>characterentity</I>. For example, the command ``&amp;lt;''inserts that pesky less-than symbol into the rendered text. Similarly,``&amp;gt;'' inserts the greater-than symbol, and``&amp;amp;'' inserts an ampersand. There can be no spacesbetween the ampersand, the entity name, and the required, trailingsemicolon. (Semicolons aren't special characters; you don't need touse an ampersand sequence to normally display a semicolon.)<P CLASS=para>You also may replace the entity name after the ampersand with adecimal value between 0 and 255 corresponding to the entity's positionin the character set. Hence, the sequence ``&amp;#60;'' doesthe same thing as ``&amp;lt;'' and represents the less-thansymbol. In fact, you could substitute all the normal characters withinan HTML document with ampersand-special characters,such as ``&amp;#65;'' for a capital ``A'' or``&amp;#97;'' for its lowercase version, but that would besilly. A complete listing of all characters, their names, andnumerical equivalents can be found in <A HREF="appd_01.htm">Appendix D</A>.<P CLASS=para>Keep in mind that not all special characters can be rendered by allbrowsers. Some browsers just ignore many of the special characters;with others, the characters aren't available in the charactersets on a specific platform. Be sure to test your documents on a rangeof browsers before electing to use some of the more obscure characterentities.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH03-SECT-4.3">Comments</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Comments are another type of textual content that appear in the sourceHTML document, but are not rendered by the user'sbrowser. Comments fall between the special<tt CLASS=literal>&lt;!--</tt> and<tt CLASS=literal>--&gt;</tt> markup elements. Browsersignore the text between the comment character sequences.<P CLASS=para>Here's a sample comment:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>&lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;&lt;!-- This is a multiple line commentthat ends on this line --&gt;</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>There must be a space after the initial<tt CLASS=literal>&lt;!--</tt> and preceding the final<tt CLASS=literal>--&gt;</tt>, but you can put nearly anythinginside the comment otherwise. The biggest exception to this rule isthat the HTML standard doesn't let you nestcomments.[2]<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[2] Netscape does let you nest comments, but the practice istricky; you cannot always predict how other browsers will reactto nested comments.</blockquote><P CLASS=para> As we mentioned above, Internet Explorer also lets youplace comments within a special <TT>&lt;comment&gt;</TT>tag. Everything between the <TT>&lt;comment&gt;</TT> and<TT>&lt;/comment&gt;</TT> tag is ignored by Internet Explorer, butall other browsers will display the comment to the user. Because ofthis undesirable behavior, we do not recommend using the<TT>&lt;comment&gt;</TT> tag for comments. Instead, always use the<tt CLASS=literal>&lt;!--</tt> and<tt CLASS=literal>--&gt;</tt> sequences to delimit comments.<P CLASS=para> Besides the obvious use of comments forHTML source documentation, many World Wide Webservers use comments to take advantage of features specific to thedocument server software. These servers scan the document for specificcharacter sequences within conventional HTMLcomments and then perform some action based upon the commands embeddedin the comments. The action might be as simple as including text fromanother file (known as a <I CLASS=emphasis>server-side include</I>) oras complex as executing other commands on the server to dynamicallygenerate the document contents.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch03_03.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch03_05.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>HTML Tags</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>HTML Document Elements</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
