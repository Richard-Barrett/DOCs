In order to give local users more control, browsers letthem select text and background colors, as well as a backgroundimage to display behind each document. The user selections are applied toeach document viewed.<P CLASS=para>In an egalitarian move, the browsers also extendedHTML with various tags and attributes that let thedocument author control the document background and colors. These tagsand attributes provide the maximum control to the author, lettingcolors and backgrounds be different for each document and allowingcolor changes for individual passages of text. <I CLASS=emphasis>[<TT>&lt;font&gt;</TT>, <A HREF="ch04_06.htm#USING-HTML-CH04-SECT-6.3">4.6.3</A>]</I><P CLASS=para>The local browser reigns supreme, however. User-selected color andbackground preferences can be made to override those contained in adocument, undoing all the careful work of the document author.<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1">Extensions to the <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> Tag</A></h3><P CLASS=para><A NAME="CH05.BODYTAG1"></A><A NAME="CH05.BODYTAG2"></A><A NAME="CH05.BODYTAG3"></A>All extended attributes that control the document background,text color, and document margins are used with the<TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag.  <I CLASS=emphasis>[<TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT>, <A HREF="ch03_07.htm#USING-HTML-CH03-SECT-7.1">3.7.1</A>]</I><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.1">The bgcolor attribute</A></h4><P CLASS=para>  For Netscape and Internet Explorer users, you can change the defaultbackground color in the browser window to another hue with thebgcolor attribute for the <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT>tag. Like the color attribute for the<TT>&lt;font&gt;</TT> and various heading tags, the required valueof the bgcolor attribute may be expressed in eitherof two ways: as the red, green, and blue (RGB)components of the desired color or as a standard color name. <A HREF="appe_01.htm">Appendix E, <i>Color Names and Values</i></A>, provides a complete discussion ofRGB color encoding along with a table of acceptablecolor names you can use with the bgcolor attribute.<P CLASS=para>Setting the background color is easy. To get a pure red backgroundusing RGB encoding, try:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;body bgcolor="#FF0000"&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>For a more subtle background, try:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;body bgcolor=peach&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.2">The background attribute</A></h4><P CLASS=para>  If a splash of color isn't enough, you may also place an imageinto the background of a Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorerdocument display with the background attribute in its<TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag.<P CLASS=para>The required value of the background attribute is theURL of an image. The browser automatically repeats(tiles) the image both horizontally and vertically to fill the entirewindow.<P CLASS=para>You normally should choose a small, somewhat dim image to create aninteresting, but unobtrusive background pattern. Besides, a small,simple image traverses the network much faster than an intricate,full-screen image.<P CLASS=para><A HREF="ch05_03.htm#USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-18">Figure 5-18</A> shows you how the extendedbrowsers repeatedly render a single brick to create a wall of bricksfor the document background:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;body background="pics/onebrick.gif"&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV><DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-18">Figure 5-18: One brick becomes many in a Netscape background</A></h4><p><img align=middle src="./figs/uhtml0518.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-18]" width=500 height=220></DIV><P CLASS=para>Background images of various dimensions and sizes create interestingvertical and horizontal effects on the page. For instance, a tallskinny image might set off your document heading:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;body background="pics/vertical_fountain.gif"&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;h3&gt;</TT>Kumquat Lore<TT>&lt;/h3&gt;</TT>For centuries, many myths and legends have arisen around the kumquat.</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>If the <I CLASS=emphasis>vertical_fountain.gif</I> is a narrow, tallimage whose color grows lighter towards its base and whose lengthexceeds the length of the document body, the resulting document mightlook like the one shown in <A HREF="ch05_03.htm#USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-19">Figure 5-19</A>.<DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-19">Figure 5-19: A tall and skinny background</A></h4><p><img align=middle src="./figs/uhtml0519.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-19]" width=500 height=252></DIV><P CLASS=para>You can achieve a similar effect horizontally with an image that ismuch wider than it is long (<A HREF="ch05_03.htm#USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-20">Figure 5-20</A>).<DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-20">Figure 5-20: A long and skinny background</A></h4><p><img align=middle src="./figs/uhtml0520.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-20]" width=500 height=252></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.3">The bgproperties attribute</A></h4><P CLASS=para>  The bgproperties attribute extension for the<TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag is exclusive to Internet Explorer and onlyworks in conjunction with the background attributeextension. The bgproperties attribute has a singlevalue, <tt CLASS=literal>fixed</tt>. It freezes the background image tothe browser window, so it does not scroll with the other windowcontents. Hence, the example <I CLASS=emphasis>H2Omark.gif</I> backgroundimage servers as a watermark for the document:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;body background="pics/H2Omark.gif" bgproperties="fixed"&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.4">The text attribute</A></h4><P CLASS=para>  Once you alter a document's background color or add a backgroundimage, you also might need to adjust the text color to ensure thatusers can read the text. The text attribute for the<TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag does just that: it sets the color of allnonanchor text in the entire document.<P CLASS=para>Give the text attribute a color value in the sameformat as you use to specify a background color (seebgcolor above)--an RGBtriplet or color name, as described in <A HREF="appe_01.htm">Appendix E</A>. For example, to produce a document withblue text on a pale yellow background, use:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;body bgcolor="#777700" text="blue"&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>Of course, it's best to select a text color that contrasts well with your background color or image.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.5">The link, vlink, and alink attributes</A></h4><P CLASS=para>      The link, vlink, andalink attributes of the <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tagcontrol the color of hypertext (<TT>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag) in yourdocuments. All three accept values that specify a color as anRGB triplet or color name, just like thetext and bgcolor attributes.<P CLASS=para>The link attribute determines the color of allhyperlinks the user has not yet followed. The vlinkattribute sets the color of all links the extended browser userhad followed at one time or another. The alinkattribute defines a color for active link text--one that iscurrently selected by the user and is under the mouse cursor with themouse button depressed.<P CLASS=para>Interestingly, Netscape is the only browser that actually defines aseparate color for alink text, so it's theonly browser for which the alink attribute to the<TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag applies; the others, including InternetExplorer, ignore it.<P CLASS=para>Like text color, you should be careful to select link colors that canbe read against the document background. Moreover, the link colorsshould be different from the regular text as well as from each other.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.6">The leftmargin attribute</A></h4><P CLASS=para>  Peculiar to Internet Explorer, the leftmargin attribute extension for the<TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag lets you indent the left margin relativeto the left edge of the browser's window, much like a margin ona sheet of paper. Other browsers ignore this attribute and normallyleft-justified body content abuts the left edge of the documentwindow.<P CLASS=para>The value of the leftmarginattribute is the integer number of pixels for that left-margin indent;a value of 0 is the default. The margin is filled with the backgroundcolor or image.<P CLASS=para>For example, Internet Explorer renders the following text justifiedagainst a margin 50 pixels away from the left edge of the browserwindow (<A HREF="ch05_03.htm#USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-21">Figure 5-21</A>):<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;body leftmargin=50&gt;</TT>Internet Explorer lets you indent the<TT>&lt;br&gt;</TT>&amp;lt;--left margin<TT>&lt;br&gt;</TT>away from the left edge of the window. <TT>&lt;/body&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV><DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-21">Figure 5-21: Internet Explorer's leftmargin attribute for indenting body content</A></h4><p><img align=middle src="./figs/uhtml0521.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-21]" width=500 height=145></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.7">The topmargin attribute</A></h4><P CLASS=para>  Like leftmargin, the topmargin attribute extension currently isexclusive to Internet Explorer. It may be included in the<TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag to set a margin of space at the top of thedocument. The margin space is filled with the document'sbackground color or image.<P CLASS=para>Body content begins flowing below the integer number of pixels youspecify as the value for topmargin; a value of 0 isthe default.<P CLASS=para>For example, Internet Explorer renders the following text at least 50pixels down from the top edge of the browser window (<A HREF="ch05_03.htm#USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-22">Figure 5-22</A>):<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;body topmargin=50&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;center&gt;</TT>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<TT>&lt;/center&gt;</TT>Internet Explorer can give your documents a little extra headroom. <TT>&lt;/body&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV><DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-FIG-22">Figure 5-22: Internet Explorer's topmargin attribute for lowering body content</A></h4><p><img align=middle src="./figs/uhtml0522.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 5-22]" width=500 height=156></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.1.8">Mixing and matching body attributes</A></h4><P CLASS=para>Although background and bgcolor attributes can appear in the same<TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT> tag, a background image will effectively hidethe selected background color unless the image contains substantialportions of transparent color, as we described earlier in thischapter. But even if the image does hide the background color, goahead and include the bgcolorattribute and some appropriate color value. That's because userscan turn off image downloading, which includes background images, andso they may find your page otherwise left naked andunappealing. Moreover, without a bgcolor attribute or a downloaded (forwhatever reason) background image, the extended browsers merrilyignore your text and link color attributes, too, reverting instead toits own default values, or the ones chosen by the user.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.2">Extending a Warning</A></h3><P CLASS=para>The various color and image extensions work wonderfully, particularlythe colorful ones, assuming that all users have a 256-color display,lots of available memory, unlimited network bandwidth, and good visualacuity. In reality, many users have monochrome or limited colordisplays, limited memory for caching images, extremely restrictednetwork bandwidth, and poor vision.<P CLASS=para>Because of these limitations, you should seriously consider not usingany of these extensions in your documents. Much like early users ofthe Macintosh felt compelled to create documents using ransom-notetypography (``I've got 40 fonts on this thing, andI'm going to use them all!''), many authors of Netscape- orInternet Explorer-specific documents cannot avoid adding some sort oftextured background to every document they create (``I'vegot 13 wood grains and 22 kinds of marbling, andI'm going to use them all!'').<P CLASS=para>In reality, except for the very clever ones, texture-mappedbackgrounds add no information to your documents. The value of yourdocument ultimately lies in its text and imagery, not the cheesy blueswirly pattern in the background. No matter how cool it looks, yourreaders are not benefiting and could be losing readability.<P CLASS=para>We advise you not to use the color extensions except for comparativelyfrivolous endeavors or unless the extension really adds to thedocument's value, such as for business advertising and marketingpages.<DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.2.1">Problems with background images</A></h4><P CLASS=para><A NAME="CH05.COLORP"></A>Here are some of the things that can go wrong with background images:<P><UL CLASS=itemizedlist><li CLASS=listitem>The time to load the document is increased by the amount oftime needed to load the image. Until the background image iscompletely downloaded, no further document rendering is possible.<P><li CLASS=listitem>The background image takes up room in the browser'slocal cache, displacing other images that might actually containuseful information. This makes other documents, which might not evenhave backgrounds, take that much longer to load.<P><li CLASS=listitem>The colors in the image may not be available on the user'sdisplay, forcing the browser to dither the image. This replaces largeareas of a single color with repeating patterns of several othercloser, but not cleaner, colors and can make the text moredifficult to read.<P><li CLASS=listitem>Because the browser must actuallydisplay an image in the background, as opposed to filling an area witha single color, scrolling through the document can take much longer.<P><li CLASS=listitem>Even if it's clear onscreen, text printed on top of an imageinvariably is more difficult if not impossible to read.<P><li CLASS=listitem>Fonts vary widely between machines; the ones you use with your browserthat work fine with a background pattern often end up jagged anddifficult to read on another machine.<P></UL></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.2.2">Problems with background, text, and link colors</A></h4><P CLASS=para>There also are a slew of problems you will encounter if you play withbackground colors, including:<P><UL CLASS=itemizedlist><li CLASS=listitem>The color you choose, while just lovely in your eyes, may lookterrible to the user. Why annoy them by changing what users mostlikely have already set as their own default background color?<P><li CLASS=listitem>While you may be a member of the ``light text on a darkbackground'' school of document design, many people also favorthe ``dark text on a light background'' style that has beenconsistently popular for over three thousand years. Instead of buckingthe trend, assume that the user has already set their browser to acomfortable color scheme.<P><li CLASS=listitem>Some users are color-blind. What may be a nifty-looking combination ofcolors to you, may be completely unreadable to others. One combinationin particular to avoid is green for unvisited links and red forvisited links. Millions of men are afflicted with red/green colorblindness.<P><li CLASS=listitem>Your brilliant hue may not be available on the user's display,and the browser may be forced to choose one that's closeinstead. For displays with very few colors (like those of severalmillion 16-color VGA Windows-based machinescurrently in use) the close colors for the text and the backgroundmight be the same color!<P><li CLASS=listitem>For the same reasons above, active, unvisited, and visited links mayall wind up the same color on limited-color displays.<P><li CLASS=listitem>By changing text colors, particularly those for visited and unvisitedlinks, you may completely confuse the user. By changing those colors,you effectively force them to experiment with your page, clicking afew links here and there to learn your color scheme.<P><li CLASS=listitem>Most page designers have no formal training in either cognitivepsychology, fine arts, graphic arts, or industrial design, yet feelfully capable of selecting appropriate colors for their documents. Ifyou must fiddle with the colors, ask a professional to pick them foryou.<P></UL></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-3.2.3">And, then again</A></h4><P CLASS=para>There is no denying the fact that these extensions result in some verystunning HTML documents. And they are fun toexplore and play with. So, rather than leave this chapter on a sournote of caution, we encourage you to go ahead and play: just playcarefully.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch05_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch05_04.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Inserting Images in Your Documents</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Background Audio</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
