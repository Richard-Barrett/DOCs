These applications aretypically small tools, hence the term ``applet,'' thatenhance the HTML page being displayed.<P CLASS=para><A NAME="CH05.MULTAPPLET"></A><A NAME="CH05.APPLETS"></A>Although currently supported only by Netscape Navigator version 2.0 andHotJava from Sun Microsystems,[4] applets, particularly those prepared with the Java language, willbecome a sizeable part of mainstream Web activity. Many other browservendors have promised support for Java.<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[4] Sun released an alpha version of HotJava in 1995. That version is nowobsolete, but a new version has not been released as of March 1996.</blockquote><P CLASS=para>Applets, like client-side image maps, represent a shift in the basicmodel of Web communications. Until recently, all computational work onthe Web was performed by the server, with the browser being nothingmore than a glorified terminal. With applets and client-side imagemaps, some or all of the computational load is shifted to the clientand browser.<P CLASS=para>They also represent a way of extending a browser's featureswithout forcing users to purchase or otherwise acquire a new browser,as is the case when developers implement new tag and attributeextensions to HTML. Nor do users have to acquireand install any special application, as is required for helper orplugin applications. This means that once users have a browser thatsupports applets, you can deliver HTML display andmultimedia innovations immediately.<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.1">The Applet Model</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Applets are like other accessory parts of an HTMLdocument. When the page is loaded by the browser, it may containspecial tags that identify applets to be downloaded and executed bythe browser. Like other Web resources, applets are identified by aURL and retrieved via the normal HTTPprotocol.<P CLASS=para>Once downloaded, the browser provides a portion of the document forthe applet to use as its display space. The author may control thesize and position of this display area; the applet controls what ispresented inside.<P CLASS=para>After arriving on the browser, the applet begins execution. It hasaccess to a restricted environment within the user's computer. Severalapplets may be placed in a single document; they all execute inparallel and may communicate with each other.<P CLASS=para>Applets have access to the mouse and keyboard, and may receive inputfrom the user. They can initiate network connections and retrieve datafrom other servers on the Internet. In sum, applets are full-fledgedprograms, complete with a variety of input and output mechanisms,along with a full suite of network services. While the browser maylimit their access to its computer system, applets have completecontrol of their virtual environment within the browser.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.2">The Applet Advantage</A></h3><P CLASS=para>There are several advantages of applets, not the least of which isproviding more compelling user interfaces within a Web page. Forinstance, an applet might create a graphical user interface andpresent the user with menus, choices, text fields, and similar inputtools. When the user clicks a button within the applet's region, theapplet can respond by displaying results within the region, signallinganother applet, or even by loading a completely new page into thebrowser.<P CLASS=para>Without applets, interactions between the user and theHTML document are more restricted and lessresponsive--such as with forms--principally because a serverand its incumbent Internet connections are involved. By allowing theaction to occur locally via an applet, responsiveness is greatlyimproved, thereby opening up a wealth of interactive opportunities.<P CLASS=para>We don't mean to imply that the only use of applets is toenhance the user interface. An applet is a full-fledged program thatcan perform any number of computational and display tasks on theclient computer. An applet might implement a real-time video display,or perform circuit simulation, or engage the user in a game, forinstance.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.3">Using Applets Correctly</A></h3><P CLASS=para>An applet is nothing more than another tool you may use to producecompelling and useful Web pages. Keep in mind that an applet usescomputational resources on the client to run and therefore places aload on the user's computer. It can degrade system performance.<P CLASS=para>Similarly, if an applet uses a lot of network bandwidth to accomplishits task (a real-time video feed, for example), it may make othernetwork communication unbearably slow. While such applications arefun, they do little more than annoy your target audience.<P CLASS=para>To use an applet correctly, balance the load between the browser andthe server: For each page, decide which tasks are best left to theserver (forms processing, index searches, and the like) and whichtasks are better suited for local processing (user interfaceenhancements, real-time data presentation, small animations, and soon). Divide the processing accordingly. Remember that many users haveslower network connections and computers than you do and designyour applets to satisfy the majority of your audience.<P CLASS=para>Used the right way, applets seamlessly enhance your pages andprovide a satisfying experience for your audience. Used improperly,applets are just another annoying bandwidth waster, alienating yourusers and hurting your pages.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.4">Writing Applets</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Creating applets is a programming task, not necessarily a job for theHTML author, and certainly way beyond the scope ofthis book. For details, we recommend you consult any of the manyapplet programming texts that have recently appeared on bookshelveseverywhere, including <I CLASS=emphasis>Java in a Nutshell</I> fromO'Reilly &amp; Associates.<P CLASS=para>Today, one language dominates the applet programming world:Java. Developed by Sun Microsystems, Java is a restricted form of C++and supports an object-oriented programming style wherein classes ofapplets can be used and reused to build complexapplications. JavaScript, from Netscape Communications, is a simplerand compatible form of Java that makes programming somewhateasier. And, surely, other Java-like applet development environmentswill emerge as the technology catches on.<P CLASS=para>By invention, applets built from the same language should run with anybrowser that supports them. So far, that is the case for Javaapplets. But the technology is so new it's hard to predictwhether cross-platform integrity and universal support for all commonbrowsers and computers will prove a reality or a pipe dream. If theconfusion of browsers is any indication.... Well, be forewarned.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.5">The <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> Tag</A></h3><P CLASS=para><A NAME="CH05.APPLETTAG1"></A><A NAME="CH05.APPLETTAG2"></A>The <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag extension currently is supportedonly in Netscape 2.0 and HotJava. Use it within yourHTML document to name an application to bedownloaded and executed with the current document and to define aregion within the document display for the application's displayarea. You may also supply alternative content within the<TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag for display by browsers that do notsupport applets.<DIV CLASS=sidebar><P CLASS=sidebar><BLOCKQUOTE><TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> (Netscape only)<DL CLASS=variablelist><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Function:</I><DD><P CLASS=para>Insert an application into the current text flow<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Attributes:</I><DD>ALIGN, ALTCODE, CODE, BASE, HEIGHT, HSPACE, NAME, VSPACE, and WIDTH<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>End tag:</I><DD><P CLASS=para><TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT>; never omitted<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Contains:</I><DD><P CLASS=para><tt CLASS=replaceable><i>applet_content</i></tt><p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Used in:</I><DD><P CLASS=para><tt CLASS=replaceable><i>text</i></tt></DL></BLOCKQUOTE><P></DIV><P CLASS=para>The <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag defines an application that isdownloaded and executed within the current document with its displayin a discrete region in the document window. One required attributeidentifies the class name of the applet program. Optional attributeslet you control the alignment and dimensions of the applet displayregion and specify an alternative URL for theclass' code.<P CLASS=para>The browser inserts the applet display region into the containing textflow exactly like an inline image--without line breaks, as asingle large entity.<P CLASS=para>Most applets require one or more parameters to control theirexecution. These parameters are placed between the<TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag and its corresponding<TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT> end tag using the <TT>&lt;param&gt;</TT>tag. The browser retrieves the applet program from the server when theHTML document is displayed by the user. It thenexecutes the applet, feeding it parameters from inside the<TT>&lt;param&gt;</TT> tag. Execution continues until the codeterminates itself or when the user stops viewing the page containingthe applet.<DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.5.1">The align attribute</A></h4><P CLASS=para> Like an image, you may control the alignment of an applet'sdisplay region with respect to its surrounding text. In fact, the<TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag's align attribute honors all the alignmentvalues used by Netscape's <TT>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag, including<tt CLASS=literal>top</tt>, <tt CLASS=literal>texttop</tt>,<tt CLASS=literal>middle</tt>, <tt CLASS=literal>absmiddle</tt>,<tt CLASS=literal>baseline</tt>, <tt CLASS=literal>bottom</tt>, and<tt CLASS=literal>absbottom,</tt> as well as <tt CLASS=literal>left</tt> and<tt CLASS=literal>right</tt> alignments for wrapping text. <I CLASS=emphasis>[image alignment, <A HREF="ch05_02.htm#USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-2.6.4">5.2.6.4</A>]</I></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.5.2">The alt attribute</A></h4><P CLASS=para> The alt attribute gives you a wayto gracefully tell users something is missing if, for somereason, the applet cannot or will not run. Its value is aquote-enclosed message string that, like the alt attribute for images, gets displayed inlieu of the applet itself.<P CLASS=para>The alt message is only for browsers that supportapplets and is there to let the user know that they've disabledapplet execution, that the applet may not be accessible, or that theapplet may have executed incorrectly. See <A HREF="ch05_06.htm#USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.5.8">5.6.5.8</A> to find out how to inform usersof other browsers why they can't view an applet.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.5.3">The code attribute</A></h4><P CLASS=para> The code attribute is the onlyrequired one and defines the class of <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT>program code to be executed. Its value may be either a simpleclass name or a fully qualified package. Use a conventional name tospecify a class. Define packages using a hierarchy of package namesseparated by periods (.).<P CLASS=para>For example, to execute an instance of a class named<tt CLASS=literal>Clock</tt>, you might use:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;applet code=Clock&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>Similarly, if the <tt CLASS=literal>Clock</tt> class is part of a package,you might use that package's fully qualified name:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;applet code=time.clock.Clock&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>The browser will locate the code for the applet using the currentdocument's base URL. The browserautomatically appends the suffix ``.class'' to the classname. Hence, if the current document's URL is:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>http://www.kumquat.com/harvest_time.html</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>the browser would retrieve the applet code for our<tt CLASS=literal>Clock</tt> class example above as:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>http://www.kumquat.com/Clock.class</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>Package names get handled slightly differently. Each element of thepackage name becomes a directory within the URLpath. Hence, the browser will retrieve our<I CLASS=emphasis>time.clock.Clock</I> package example as:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>http://www.kumquat.com/time/clock/Clock.class</PRE></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.5.4">The codebase attribute</A></h4><P CLASS=para> The code attribute value is not aURL. Use the codebase attribute to provide an alternativebase URL from which the applet code is to beretrieved. The value of this attribute is a URLpointing to a directory containing the class defined by the code attribute. The codebase URL overrides,but does not permanently replace the document's baseURL, which is the default if nocodebase is used. <I CLASS=emphasis>[URLs, <A HREF="ch06_02.htm#USING-HTML-CH06-SECT-2">6.2</A>]</I><P CLASS=para>Continuing with our previous example, suppose the<tt CLASS=literal>Clock</tt> class is kept in a separate directory named<tt CLASS=literal>classes</tt>. You could retrieve the applet byspecifying:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;applet code=Clock codebase="http://www.kumquat.com/classes/"&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>which resolves to the URL:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>http://www.kumquat.com/classes/Clock.class.</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>Although we used an absolute URL in this example,you also can use a relative URL. For instance, inmost cases the applets are stored on the same server as the hostHTML documents, so we'd usually be betteroff, for relocation sake, specifying a relative URLfor the codebase, such as:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;applet code=Clock codebase="/classes/"&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.5.5">The name attribute</A></h4><P CLASS=para> The name attribute lets you supplya unique name for this instance of the code class. This attribute isnot required unless you need to reference the applet instanceelsewhere in your document via another applet.<P CLASS=para>For example, suppose you have two clock applets in your document,along with two applets used to set those clocks. You provide uniquenames for the clocks using the nameattribute, then pass those names to the setting applets using the<TT>&lt;param&gt;</TT> tag, which we discuss below:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;applet code=Clock name=clock1&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;applet code=Clock name=clock2&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;applet code=Setter&gt;</TT>  <TT>&lt;param name=clockToSet value=clock1&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;applet code=Setter&gt;</TT>  <TT>&lt;param name=clockToSet value=clock2&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>Since we have no need to distinguish between the Setter applets, wechoose not to name their instances.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.5.6">The height and width attributes</A></h4><P CLASS=para>  Identical to the counterparts for the <TT>&lt;img&gt;</TT> tag, theheight and width attributes define the size of theapplet's display region in the document. They both accept valuesindicating the size of the region in pixels.  <I CLASS=emphasis>[<TT>&lt;img&gt;</TT> height and width, <A HREF="ch05_02.htm#USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-2.6.9">5.2.6.9</A>]</I><P CLASS=para>The display region's dimensions often must match some otherapplet requirement, so be careful to check these values with theapplet programmer. Sometimes, the applet may scale its display outputto match your specified region.<P CLASS=para>For example, suppose our example clock applet should grow or shrink tofit nearly any size display region. Hence, we might create a squareclock 100 pixels wide by 100 pixels tall:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;applet code=Clock height=100 width=100&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.5.7">The hspace and vspace attributes</A></h4><P CLASS=para>  As with an image, surrounding text tightly abuts the applet displayregion. The hspace and vspace attributes let you interpose someempty space around the applet region to set it off from the text. Bothattributes accept a value that indicates pixels of space, with the hspace attribute creating a space to the leftand right of the region; the vspaceattribute adding space above and below the region.<P CLASS=para>For example, to give our clock some breathing room on the page, wecould place an additional five pixels of space around it:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;applet code=Clock height=100 width=100   hspace=5 vspace=5&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.5.8">Supporting incompatible browsers</A></h4><P CLASS=para>Since most of today's browsers do not support applets or the<TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag, you may sometimes need to tell readerswhat they are missing. You do this by includingHTML body content between the<TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT> tags.<P CLASS=para>Browsers that support the <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tags ignore theHTML content inside. (Use the alt attribute to notify applet-enabledbrowser users when the applet doesn't display for some reason.)Of course, browsers that don't support applets don'trecognize the <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tags. Being generally tolerantof apparent HTML mistakes, they will usually ignorethe unrecognized tag and blithely go on to display whatever contentmay appear inside. It's as simple as that. The following fragmenttells applet-incapable browser users they won't see our clockexample:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;applet code=Clock&gt;</TT>  If your browser were capable of handling applets, you'd see  a nifty clock right here!<TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>Remember that this contained text is different from the text suppliedby the alt attribute of the<TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag. The alt text isdisplayed by browsers that support the <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tagbut cannot execute or display the specified applet. The contained textis displayed by browsers that do not support the<TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag at all. In order to accomodate bothclasses of browsers, the considerate author supplies both for each<TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;applet code=Clock height=100 width=100  alt="[ Clock applet not available ]"&gt;</TT>  <TT>&lt;param name=style value=analog&gt;</TT>  If your browser were capable of handling applets, you'd see  a nifty analog clock right here!<TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.6">The <TT>&lt;param&gt;</TT> Tag</A></h3><P CLASS=para><A NAME="CH05.PARAM1"></A><A NAME="CH05.PARAM2"></A><A NAME="CH05.PARAM3"></A>The <TT>&lt;param&gt;</TT> tag supplies parameters for thecontaining <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT> tag.<DIV CLASS=sidebar><P CLASS=sidebar><BLOCKQUOTE><TT>&lt;param&gt;</TT> (Netscape only)<DL CLASS=variablelist><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Function:</I><DD><P CLASS=para>Supply a parameter to an <TT>&lt;applet&gt;</TT><p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Attributes:</I><DD>NAME, and VALUE<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>End tag:</I><DD><P CLASS=para>None<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Contains:</I><DD><P CLASS=para>Nothing<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Used in:</I><DD><P CLASS=para><tt CLASS=replaceable><i>applet_content</i></tt></DL></BLOCKQUOTE><P></DIV><P CLASS=para>The <TT>&lt;param&gt;</TT> tag has no content and no end tag.

Use the<TT>&lt;param&gt;</TT> tag to pass parameters to the applet programas required for it to function correctly.<DIV CLASS=sect3><h4 CLASS=sect3><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6.6.1">The name and value attributes</A></h4><P CLASS=para>  The <TT>&lt;param&gt;</TT> tag has two required attributes: name and value. Both attributes accept strings astheir value and together define a name/value pair that is passed tothe applet.<P CLASS=para>For instance, our Clock applet example might let you specify the timezone by which it sets its hour hand. To pass the parameter named``timezone'' with the value``EST'' to our example applet, you wouldspecify the parameters as:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE><TT>&lt;applet code=Clock&gt;</TT>  <TT>&lt;param name=timezone value=EST&gt;</TT><TT>&lt;/applet&gt;</TT></PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>Since both attributes had simple strings for values, we did notenclose the values in quotes. For values with embedded punctuation andspaces, be sure to delimit the strings accordingly.<P CLASS=para>The browser will pass the name/value pairs to the applet, but that isno guarantee that the applet is expecting the parameters, that thenames and values are correct, or that the applet will even use theparameters. Correct parameter names, including capitalization, andacceptable values are determined by the applet author. The wiseHTML document author will work closely with theapplet author or have detailed documentation to ensure that the appletparameters are named correctly and assigned valid values.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch05_05.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch05_07.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Animated Text</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Other Multimedia Content</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
