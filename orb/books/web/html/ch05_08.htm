A working group beganadapting and enhancing a graphics-description language previouslydeveloped at Silicon Graphics Inc. to be used withHTML and Web software.<P CLASS=para>The result was Virtual Reality Markup Language(VRML). VRML follows theHTML model in several important respects. LikeHTML, VRML is a content-based,plain-ASCII markup language that describes itsuniverse at a high level, and leaves it up to the browser or clientprogram to make detailed presentation decisions.VRML technology has since evolved even more rapidlythan the Web itself. As of January 1996, several first-cutVRML browsers are available, including an add-onfor the popular Netscape browser for PCs.<P CLASS=para>VRML documents describe worlds populated with3D shapes. Developers build objects from basic shapes,such as cubes, cones, and spheres, with a variety of surfaceeffects, including texture maps and lighting, available for composingrealistic objects. It's possible to associate URLswith objects in a VRML world in such a waythat when a user touches the object, they are transported to anotherVRML world, an HTML document, ora CGI script (which itself may generate aVRML world).<P CLASS=para>Some intriguing demonstration interfaces to large databases havealready been built and suggest the beginnings of true cyberspacearchitecture. So far, however, these demonstrations fall short of thestrong virtual-reality experience depicted in science-fiction booksand movies. Three related problems bar the way. The design problemis that VRML currently has no capacity to do animation.VRML worlds are static. While it's easy to move theuser's viewpoint in a VRML world, the only way toactually move or alter a VRML object is to generate anentirely new document and render it. Proposals to support animationdescription are in the works, but none have yet been adopted as ofJanuary 1996. This may well have changed by the time you read this.<P CLASS=para>The second, practical problem is that reasonably priced desktopmachines in 1996 simply don't have the capacity to do realisticanimation of general scenes. The computational cost of point-plotting,hidden-line elimination, texture-mapping, and lighting calculationsgets very large, very quickly. Companies that care about animation,like Industrial Light and Magic, use multimillion-dollarspecial-purpose supercomputers for this job because they haveto. Current VRML browsers, for example, frequentlyhave to drop back from full-surface rendering to wire-frame mode whenmoving the viewer's eyepoint. Even without animation, rendering ofstatic images including texture-mapping, spheres and sculpted surfacescan take many seconds, which is unacceptably slow.<P CLASS=para>The third problem is that VRML worlds are not yetshared spaces. For virtual reality to begin to approach theinteractive richness of the real world, it must be possible tointeract in a VRML world not merely withobjects but with the ``avatar'' or cyberspatialmanifestations of other users. This is an area of very active interestto the VRML developers (many of whom have beendirectly inspired by the Black Sun environment depicted in NeilStephenson's immensely popular science-fiction novel, <I CLASS=emphasis>SnowCrash</I>), but no single solution has yet emerged.<P CLASS=para>(There are other, comparatively minor problems:VRML has no sound capability, for example. But it'seasy to imagine a solution for this one within current technology.)<P CLASS=para>Thus, VRML is still currently more a promise and atechnology direction than a complete answer to the virtual-realityquestion. But the trend-curves of desktop hardware performance and theamount of money being poured into better multimedia graphicsaccelerators make it one worth careful watching. With another fewyears' hardware evolution and a few foreseeableVRML language enhancements, a true distributedcyberspace, built around and using WWW servers, maywell be within our reach.</DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch05_07.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch06_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Other Multimedia Content</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Links and Webs</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
