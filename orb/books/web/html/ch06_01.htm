The true powerof HTML, however, lies in its ability to joincollections of documents together into a full library of information,and to link documents with other collections around the world. Just asreaders have considerable control over how thedocument looks onscreen, with hyperlinks they also have control overthe order of presentation as they navigate through yourinformation. It's the ``HT'' inHTML--hypertext--and it's the twistthat spins the Web.<DIV CLASS=sect1><h2 CLASS=sect1><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH06-SECT-1">6.1 Hypertext Basics</A></h2><P CLASS=para><A NAME="CH06.LINKS"></A>A fundamental feature of hypertext is that you can hyperlinkdocuments; you can point to another place inside the current document, insideanother document in the local collection, or inside a documentanywhere on the Internet. The documents thereby become an intricatelywoven web of information. Get the name analogy now? The targetdocument is usually somehow related to and enriches the source; thelinking element in the source should convey that relationship to thereader.<P CLASS=para>Hyperlinks can be used for all kinds of effect. They can be used insidetables of contents and lists of topics. With a click of the mouse ontheir browser screen, readers select and automatically jump to a topicof interest in the same document or to another documentlocated in an entirely different collection somewhere around theworld.<P CLASS=para>Hyperlinks also  point readers to more informationabout a mentioned topic. ``For more information, see`Kumquats on Parade,''' forexample. HTML authors use hyperlinks to reducerepetitive information. For instance, we recommend you sign yourname to each of your documents. Rather than include full contactinformation in each document, a hyperlink connects yourname to a single place that contains your address,phone number, and so forth.<P CLASS=para>A hyperlink, or <I CLASS=emphasis>anchor</I> in HTMLstandard parlance, is marked by the <TT>&lt;a&gt;</TT> tag and comesin two flavors. As we detail below, one type of anchor creates a hotspot in the document that, when activated and selected (usually with amouse) by the user, causes the browser to link. It automatically loadsand displays another portion of the same or another documentaltogether, or triggers some Internet service-related action, such assending email or downloading a special file. The other type of anchorcreates a label,[1] a place in an HTML document thatcan be referenced as a hyperlink.<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[1]          Both types of HTML anchors use the same         tag; perhaps that's why they have the same name. Nonetheless, we find it's easier if you         differentiate them and think of the one type that provides         the hotspot and address of a hyperlink as the         ``link,'' and the other type that marks the target         portion of a document as the ``anchor.''</blockquote></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch05_08.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch06_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Beyond HTML</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Referencing Documents: The URL</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
