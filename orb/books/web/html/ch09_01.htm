None at all[1] for a community steeped in mountains of data. And, that's just the academic community. Tables are an age-old respected means for cross-comparing items of information for all types of endeavors.<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[1] The <TT>&lt;pre&gt;</TT> tag, although capable, is hardly``support'' for tables.</blockquote><P CLASS=para>Fortunately, the developers of the popular graphical browsers,including Netscape, Internet Explorer, and Mosaic, have stepped intothe breach and come up with a fairly comprehensive set ofHTML extensions for tables. In fact, they haveeclipsed the Web standards organization devoted toHTML by including many of the table-handlingfeatures intended for inclusion in HTMLversion 3.2.<P CLASS=para>While it is relatively easy to swear off many of the other extensionsto HTML, like frivolous background images orauto-scrolling text marquees, you simply will not be able to resistthe siren call of the table extensions. They're just too usefulto ignore.<DIV CLASS=sect1><h2 CLASS=sect1><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH09-SECT-1">9.1 The HTML Table Model</A></h2><P CLASS=para>The model the extended browsers use for tables is fairlystraightforward: tables are collections of numbers and words arrangedand related in rows and columns of <I CLASS=emphasis>cells</I>. Mostcells contain the data values; others contain row and column headersthat describe the data.<P CLASS=para>You define a table and include all of its elements between the<TT>&lt;table&gt;</TT> tag and its corresponding<TT>&lt;/table&gt;</TT> end tag. Table elements, including dataitems, row and column headers, and captions, each have their ownmarkup tag. Working from left to right and top to bottom, you define,in sequence, the header and data for each column cell across thetable, and progress down row by row.<P CLASS=para>The latest browsers also support a collection of tag attributes that make your tables look good, including special alignment of the table values and headers, borders and table rule lines, and automatic sizing of the data cells to accommodate their content. Netscape and Internet Explorer each have a slightly richer set of attributes than Mosaic; we'll point out those variations as we go.<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH09-SECT-1.1">Table Contents</A></h3><P CLASS=para>You may put nearly anything you might put within the body of anHTML document inside a table cell, includingimages, forms, rules, headings, and even another table. The browsertreats each cell as a window unto itself, flowing thecell's content to fill the space, but with some specialformatting provisions and extensions.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH09-SECT-1.2">An Example Table</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Here's a quick example that should satisfy your itchingcuriosity to see what an HTML table looks like insource code and when finally rendered as in <A HREF="ch09_01.htm#USING-HTML-CH09-FIG-1">Figure 9-1</A>. More importantly, it shows you thebasic structure of a table from which you can infer many of theelements, tag syntax and order, attributes, and so on, and to whichyou may refer back as you read the various detailed descriptionsbelow:<DIV CLASS=screen><P><PRE>&lt;table border cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5&gt;  &lt;caption align=bottom&gt; Kumquat versus a poked   eye, by gender&lt;/caption&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td colspan=2 rowspan=2&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;th colspan=2 align=center&gt;Preference&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr&gt;    &lt;th&gt;Eating Kumquats&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;th&gt;Poke In The Eye&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr align=center&gt;    &lt;th rowspan=2&gt;Gender&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;th&gt;Male&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;td&gt;73%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;27%&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;tr align=center&gt;    &lt;th&gt;Female&lt;/th&gt;    &lt;td&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;84%&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</PRE></DIV><DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH09-FIG-1">Figure 9-1: HTML table example rendered by Netscape (top) and by Mosaic (bottom)</A></h4><p><img align=middle src="./figs/uhtml0901.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 9-1]" width=500 height=293></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH09-SECT-1.3">Missing Features</A></h3><P CLASS=para>HTML tables currently don't have all thefeatures of a full-fledged table-generation tool you might find in apopular word processor. Rather than leave you in suspense, we'lllist those things up front so you don't beat your head againstthe wall later trying to do something that just can't be done(at least, not yet):<P><UL CLASS=itemizedlist><li CLASS=listitem>Most browsers, save for Internet Explorer and the latest version ofNetscape Navigator (2.0), don't flow text around a table as theydo for images. Rather, they isolate a table from the text content withline breaks. The table does inherit the alignment of the current textflow--normally left-justified as with regular text, orcenter-justified, if contained within the <TT>&lt;center&gt;</TT>tag. <I CLASS=emphasis>[<TT>&lt;center&gt;</TT>, <A HREF="ch04_07.htm#USING-HTML-CH04-SECT-7.6">4.7.6</A>]</I><P><li CLASS=listitem>The general problem of text alignment in HTMLcarries over into tables. You may align values inside their individualcells, but you cannot align them between cells. For instance, youcannot vertically align the decimal points in a column of numbers,even though they all might have the same number of digits.<P><li CLASS=listitem> Mosaic's table border and rule lines are all or nothing; eitheryou include them or you don't. Netscape and Internet Explorer,on the other hand, give you the ability to set their thickness, butyou get to use only one size line for the table's borders andrules, if you choose to include them at all. You can't have athicker border separate the table headings from the table body, forexample, or have a heavier border between rows at regularintervals. Nor can you have a different-sized outside border.<P><li CLASS=listitem>HTML tables don't have running headers orfooters. Of course, such things don't matter with anHTML browser where everything is on a single,infinitely long page. Running headers and footers are nice to have,though, when you print out a long table onto separate sheets of paper.<P></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch08_06.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch09_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Using named parameters with GET applications</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Table Tags</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
