The developers at Netscape Communications found that limitationunacceptable and built in some special features to the Netscapebrowser that lets you dynamically change HTMLdocument content. In fact, they provide for two different mechanismsfor dynamic documents, which we detail in this chapter.<P CLASS=para>We should mention at the outset that many people believe Netscapedynamic documents will be obsolete in a very short time, displaced byplug-in browser accessories and, in particular, applets. Nonetheless,Netscape continues to support dynamic documents, and we believe thetechnology has virtues you should be aware of, if not take advantageof, in your HTML documents. <I CLASS=emphasis>[applets, <A HREF="ch05_06.htm#USING-HTML-CH05-SECT-6">5.6</A>]</I><DIV CLASS=sect1><h2 CLASS=sect1><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH11-SECT-1">11.1 An Overview of Dynamic Documents</A></h2><P CLASS=para>If you remember from our discussion in <A HREF="ch01_01.htm">Chapter 1, <i>HTML and the World Wide Web</i></A>, the client browser initiates data flow onthe Web by contacting a server with a document request. The serverhonors the request by downloading the document. The clientsubsequently displays the document's contents to the user. Fornormal Web documents, a single transaction initiated from the clientside is all that is needed to collect and display the document. Oncedisplayed, however, it does not change.<P CLASS=para>Dynamic documents, on the other hand, are the result of multipletransactions initiated from either or both the server side and theclient side. A <I CLASS=emphasis>client-pull</I> document is one thatinitiates multiple transactions from the client side. When the serveris the instigator, the dynamic document is known as a<I CLASS=emphasis>server-push</I> document.<P CLASS=para>In a client-pull document, special HTML codes tellthe client to periodically request and download another document fromone or more servers on the network, dynamically updating the display.<P CLASS=para>Server-push documents also advance the way servers communicate withclients. Normally over the Web, the client stays connected with aserver for only as long as it takes to retrieve a singledocument.[1] With server-push documents, the connection remains open and the server continues to periodically send data to the client, adding to or replacing the previous contents.<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[1]  One connection per document is true even for inline images browsers         may automatically download from the server. If you         don't believe us, just watch the status line at the         bottom of your browser while you download an         HTML document with several images. You         should see many ``Contacting the server'' and         ``Reading the file...'' or similar messages.</blockquote><P CLASS=para>Netscape currently is the only browser able to handle dynamicHTML documents correctly. With other browsers,you'll see part of the dynamic document at best. At worst, thebrowser will completely reject the document. Unfortunately, becausedynamic documents are client-server processes, they don't workwithout an HTTP server. That means you can'tdevelop and test your dynamic HTML documents storedas local files, unless you have a server running locally, as well.<DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="USING-HTML-CH11-SECT-1.1">Another Word of Caution</A></h3><P CLASS=para>As always, we tell you exactly how to use these exciting, butnonstandard features, and we admonish you not to use them unless youhave a compelling and overriding reason to do so. We are particularlystrident with that admonition for dynamic documents, not only becausethey aren't part of the HTML standard, butbecause dynamic documents can hog the network. They requirelarger, longer downloads than their static counterparts. And theyrequire many more (in the case of client-pull) or longer-term (forserver-push) client-server connections. Multiple connections on asingle server are limited to a few of the vast millions of Web usersat a time. We'd hate to see your readers miss out becauseyou've created a jiggling image in a dynamicHTML document that would otherwise havebeen an effective and readily accessible static document morepeople could enjoy.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch10_06.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" BORDER=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch11_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Named Frame or Window Targets</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Client-Pull Documents</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
