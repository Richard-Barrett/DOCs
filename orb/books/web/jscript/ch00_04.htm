I, and many JavaScript developers, owe      Brendan a tremendous debt of gratitude for developing JavaScript,      and for taking the time out of his crazy schedule to answer our      questions and even solicit our input. Besides patiently answering      my many questions, Brendan also read and provided helpful comments      on the beta edition of this book.    <P CLASS=para>      Nick Thompson and Richard Yaker at Netscape were also very helpful      during the development of the book. Nick answered many of my      questions about LiveConnect, and took the time to review and      comment on a draft of <A HREF="ch19_01.htm">Chapter 19, <i>LiveConnect: JavaScript and Java</i></A>.      Richard found answers for me to many miscellaneous questions, and      also provided me with the list of known bugs that are described in      <A HREF="appb_01.htm">Appendix B, <i>Known Bugs</i></A>. Lynn Rollins, a partner at      R&amp;B Communications, and a contractor for Netscape, pointed out      errors in the Beta edition of the book and also shared with me      some of the less publicized features of JavaScript in Navigator      3.0.    <P CLASS=para>      Much of my information about Internet Explorer comes from Shon      Katzenberger Ph.D., Larry Sullivan, and Dave C. Mitchell, three of      the primary developers of Microsoft's version of JavaScript. Shon      and Larry are the Software Design Engineers who developed      Microsoft's version of the JavaScript interpreter and Microsoft's      version of the JavaScript client-side object model, respectively.      Dave was the Test Lead for the project. All three reviewed the      Beta edition of the book and provided me a wealth of information      about Internet Explorer that was simply lacking before. Dave was      particularly helpful in answering my last minute questions about      IE's capabilities.    <P CLASS=para>      Neil Berkman, a software engineer at Bay Networks in Billerica,      MA, as well as Andrew Schulman and Terry Allen at O'Reilly were      technical reviewers for the Beta edition. Their comments made      that edition (and therefore this one) stronger and more accurate.      Andrew was also the editor for the Beta edition of this book, and      Frank Willison is editor of the current edition. I am grateful to      them both.    <P CLASS=para>      David Futato was the production manager for this edition of the      book and the last. He coordinated the whole process of      production, and for the Beta edition, it was he who worked      weekends and nights in order to give me time to squeeze the last      few new Beta 6 features in.      Chris Reilley produced the figures for the book. Edie Freedman      designed the cover, and Nancy Priest and Mary Jane Walsh      designed the internal format, which was implemented by Lenny      Muellner, with help from Erik Ray.  Seth Maislin indexed this book.    <P CLASS=para>      Finally, my thanks, as always      and for so many reasons, to Christie.      <DIV CLASS=literallayout><P><I CLASS=emphasis>David&nbsp;&nbsp;Flanagan</I><br><I CLASS=emphasis>November&nbsp;&nbsp;1996</I></DIV>    </DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch00_03.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Finding Examples Online</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Introduction to JavaScript</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
