It is      not yet well understood and is the subject of a fair bit of      misinformation and confusion. Before we proceed any further with      our exploration of JavaScript, it is important to debunk some      common myths about the language.    <DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.1">JavaScript Is Not Java Simplified</A></h3><P CLASS=para>	One of the most common misconceptions about JavaScript is that it is	a "simplified version" of Java, the programming language from	Sun Microsystems. Other than an incomplete syntactic resemblance	and the fact that both Java and JavaScript can deliver	"executable content" over networks, the two languages are	entirely unrelated. The similarity of names is purely a	marketing ploy (the language was originally called LiveScript,	and its name was changed to JavaScript at the last minute).      <P CLASS=para>	JavaScript and Java do, however, make a good team. The two	languages have disjoint sets of capabilities. JavaScript can	control browser behavior and content but cannot draw graphics or	perform networking. Java has no control over the browser as a	whole, but can do graphics, networking, and multithreading. In	Navigator version 3.0, JavaScript can communicate with the Java	interpreter built into the browser and can work with and control	any Java applets in a web page. This means that in this version	of Navigator, JavaScript really can "script" Java. This new	feature is called LiveConnect, and it also allows Java code to	invoke JavaScript commands. <A HREF="ch19_01.htm">Chapter 19, <i>LiveConnect: JavaScript and Java</i></A> describes LiveConnect in detail.      </DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch01-SECT2-AUTOID.2">JavaScript Is Not Simple</A></h3><P CLASS=para>	JavaScript is touted as a "scripting language" instead of a	"programming language," the implication being that scripting	languages are simpler, that they are programming languages for	nonprogrammers. Indeed, JavaScript appears at first glance to be	a fairly simple language, perhaps of the same complexity as	BASIC. Further experience with JavaScript, however, reveals	complexities that are not readily apparent. For example, the	use of objects as arguments to functions requires a careful	understanding of the difference between passing arguments "by	value" and passing arguments "by reference."  There are also a	number of tricky details to understand about converting data	values from one type to another in JavaScript.	Even the seemingly simple	<tt CLASS=literal>document.write()</tt> method that we saw	in <A HREF="ch01_01.htm#JSCRIPT-CH-INTRO-EX-1">Example 1-1</A> has nonintuitive	aspects.      <P CLASS=para>	This is not to say that JavaScript is beyond the reach of	nonprogrammers. It <I CLASS=emphasis>will</I> be useful to	nonprogrammers, but only for limited, cookbook-style tasks. For	better or worse, complete mastery of JavaScript requires	sophisticated programming skills.[3]      <blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[3] 	    And a good programmer's guide and reference, like the one	    you are reading!	  </blockquote></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch01_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_03.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Executable Content: JavaScript in a Web Page</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>What JavaScript Can Do</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
