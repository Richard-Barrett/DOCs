Part I, immediately      following this chapter, documents the standalone JavaScript      language. This is the core language common to both      client-side and server-side implementations of JavaScript.      Chapters 2 through 5 begin this section with some bland but      necessary reading--these chapters cover the topics necessary      when learning any new programming language.    <P><UL CLASS=itemizedlist><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 2, <I CLASS=emphasis>Lexical Structure</I>,	  explains the basic lexical structure of the language.	<P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 3, <I CLASS=emphasis>Variables and Data Types</I>,	  documents the data types supported by JavaScript and also covers the	  related topics of literals and identifiers.	<P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 4, <I CLASS=emphasis>Expressions and Operators</I>,	  explains expressions in JavaScript, and documents 	  each of the operators supported by JavaScript.	  Experienced C, C++, or Java	  programmers will be able to skim much of this chapter.	<P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 5, <I CLASS=emphasis>Statements</I>,	  describes the syntax and usage of each of the JavaScript statements.	  Again, experienced C, C++, and Java programmers will be able to skim	  some, but not all, of this chapter.	<P></UL><P CLASS=para>      The next four chapters of this first section become more      interesting. They still cover the core of the JavaScript      language, but document parts of the language that will not already      be familiar to you, even if you already know C or Java. These      chapters must be studied carefully if you want to really      understand JavaScript:    <P><UL CLASS=itemizedlist><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 6, <I CLASS=emphasis>Functions</I>,	  documents how functions are defined, invoked, and manipulated	  in JavaScript.	<P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 7, <I CLASS=emphasis>Objects</I>,	  explains objects, the most important JavaScript data type.	  This chapter includes a discussion of creating objects and	  defining object methods, among other important topics.	<P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 8, <I CLASS=emphasis>Arrays</I>,	  describes the creation and use of arrays in JavaScript.	<P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 9, <I CLASS=emphasis>Further Topics in JavaScript</I>,	  covers advanced topics that were not covered elsewhere. You	  can skip this chapter the first time through the book, but the	  material it contains is important to understand if you are ever	  to become a JavaScript expert.	<P></UL><P CLASS=para>      Part II of the book documents client-side JavaScript. The      chapters in this part document the web browser objects that are at      the heart of client-side JavaScript, and provide detailed examples      of their use. Any interesting JavaScript program running in a web      browser will rely heavily on features specific to the client-side.      You should read chapters 10, 11, and 12 first. After that, you can      read chapters 13 through 20 in any order you choose, although      you'll probably get the most out of this part if you read them in      the order they are presented.    <P><UL CLASS=itemizedlist><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 10, <I CLASS=emphasis>Client-Side Program Structure</I>,	  explains the various ways in which	  JavaScript is integrated into web pages for execution on the	  client side. It also discusses the order of execution of	  JavaScript programs and the event-driven programming model.	<P><li CLASS=listitem>          Chapter 11, <I CLASS=emphasis>Windows and the JavaScript Name	  Space</I>, documents the most central and important	  object of client-side JavaScript, the Window object. It also	  covers issues related to this Window object, such as the	  name space, variable lifetime, and garbage collection.      <P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 12, <I CLASS=emphasis>Programming with Windows</I>,	  discusses and illustrates specific programming techniques	  using the Window object.	<P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 13, <I CLASS=emphasis>The Navigator, Location, and History	  Objects</I>, documents the Navigator, Location, and	  History objects and shows examples of using them.      <P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 14, <I CLASS=emphasis>Documents and Their Contents</I>,	  explains the Document object, which is perhaps the second most	  important object in client-side programming. It also	  illustrates programming techniques that use this object.	<P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 15, <I CLASS=emphasis>Saving State with Cookies</I>,	  illustrates the use of "cookies" to save state in web	  programming. 	<P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 16, <I CLASS=emphasis>Special Effects with Images</I>,	  explains the Image object and demonstrates some special	  graphical effects you can produce with JavaScript.	<P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 17, <I CLASS=emphasis>Forms and Form Elements</I>,	  documents the Form object, another very crucial object in	  client-side JavaScript. It also documents the various form	  element objects that appear within HTML forms, and shows	  examples of JavaScript programming using forms.	<P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 18, <I CLASS=emphasis>Compatibility Techniques</I>,	  discusses the important issue of compatibility in JavaScript	  programming. It discusses compatibility between Navigator and	  Internet Explorer, between different versions of Navigator,	  and between JavaScript-enabled browsers and browsers that do	  not support the language.	<P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 19, <I CLASS=emphasis>LiveConnect: JavaScript and Java</I>,	  explains how you can use JavaScript to interact with Java	  classes and objects, and even communicate with and control	  Java applets. It also explains how you can do the	  reverse--invoke JavaScript code from Java applets.	  <P><li CLASS=listitem>	  Chapter 20, <I CLASS=emphasis>JavaScript Security</I>,	  provides an overview of	  security issues in JavaScript. It explains the steps taken to	  plug security holes in Navigator 2.0, and the new "tainting"	  security model that is forthcoming in Navigator 4.0.	<P></UL><P CLASS=para>      Part III is the reference section that makes up the second half of      this book. It contains complete documentation for all JavaScript      objects, methods, properties, functions, and event handlers, both      for core and client-side JavaScript.    <P CLASS=para>      Finally, Part IV is a section of appendices that you      may find useful. They include lists of commonly encountered bugs,      a list of differences between JavaScript in Navigator and Internet      Explorer, and other helpful information.    </DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch01_07.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_09.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>JavaScript Security</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Exploring JavaScript</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
