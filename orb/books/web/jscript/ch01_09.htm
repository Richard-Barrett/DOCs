As you read through this book, I encourage you      to try out JavaScript features as you learn about them. There are a      number of ways you can do this, and a number of techniques that      make it easy to experiment with JavaScript.    <P CLASS=para>            The most obvious way to explore JavaScript is to write simple      scripts. JavaScript has powerful enough features that even simple      programs, only a few lines long, can produce complex results. We      saw an example that computed factorials at the beginning of this      chapter. Suppose you wanted to modify it as follows to display      Fibonacci numbers instead:    <DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;document.write("&lt;h2&gt;Table of Fibonacci Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;");for(i=0,j=1,k=0,fib=1; i&lt;50; i++,fib=j+k,k=j,j=fib) {    document.write("Fibonacci(" + i + ") = " + fib);    document.write("&lt;br&gt;");}&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>      This code may be convoluted (and don't worry if you don't yet      understand it) but the point is that when you want to experiment      with short programs like this, you can simply type them up and try      them out in your web browser using a local      <tt CLASS=literal>file:</tt> URL. For simple JavaScript experiments      like this, you can usually omit the      <tt CLASS=literal>&lt;HTML&gt;</tt>, <tt CLASS=literal>&lt;HEAD&gt;</tt>,      and <tt CLASS=literal>&lt;BODY&gt;</tt> tags in your HTML file, and      you can even omit the <tt CLASS=literal>LANGUAGE="JavaScript"</tt>      attribute that you would include in the      <tt CLASS=literal>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</tt> tag of any production code you      wrote.    <P CLASS=para>      For even simpler experiments with JavaScript, you can sometimes      use the <tt CLASS=literal>javascript:</tt> URL pseudo-protocol to      evaluate a JavaScript expression and return the result. A      JavaScript URL consists of the <tt CLASS=literal>javascript:</tt>      protocol specifier followed by arbitrary JavaScript code (with      statements separated from one another by semicolons). When the      browser "loads" such a URL, it executes the JavaScript code. The      value of the last expression in such a URL is converted to a      string, and this string becomes the "document" specified by the      URL. For example, you might type the following JavaScript URLs      into the <b>Location</b> field of your web      browser to test your understanding of some of JavaScript's      operators and statements:    <DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>javascript:5%2javascript:x = 3; (x &lt; 5)? "x is less": "x is greater"javascript:d = new Date(); typeof d;javascript:for(i=0,j=1,k=0,fib=1; i&lt;10; i++,fib=j+k,k=j,j=fib) alert(fib);</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>      While you can type these URLs directly into the <b>Location</b> field of Navigator, you cannot do      the same in Internet Explorer 3.0. These URLs will work correctly      in IE 3.0 in hypertext links and the like, but they cannot be      entered directly.    <P CLASS=para>      In Navigator 2.0 and 3.0 (but not Internet Explorer 3.0), if you      specify the URL <tt CLASS=literal>javascript:</tt> by itself,      Navigator will display a JavaScript interpreter screen, and      JavaScript code entered into the input field in the lower frame      will be evaluated and the results displayed in the upper frame.      <A HREF="ch01_09.htm#JSCRIPT-CH-INTRO-FIG-4">Figure 1-4</A> shows this special      interpreter screen, with some example code evaluated. In this      case, the JavaScript code shown pops up a dialog box that displays      the name and value of each of the properties of the browser      window.    <DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="JSCRIPT-CH-INTRO-FIG-4">Figure 1-4: The javascript: interpreter screen</A></h4><p><img align=middle src="./figs/js0104.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 1-4]" width=500 height=681></DIV><P CLASS=para>      <A HREF="ch01_09.htm#JSCRIPT-CH-INTRO-FIG-4">Figure 1-4</A> also shows some other      useful techniques for experimenting with JavaScript. First, it      shows the use of the <tt CLASS=literal>alert()</tt> function to      display text. This function pops up a dialog box and displays      plain text (i.e., not HTML formatted) within it. It also      demonstrates the <tt CLASS=literal>for/in</tt> loop, which loops      through all the properties of an object. This is quite useful      when trying to discover which objects have what      properties. The <tt CLASS=literal>for/in</tt> loop is documented in      <A HREF="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, <i>Statements</i></A>.    <P CLASS=para>      While exploring JavaScript, you will probably write code that      doesn't work as you expect it to, and will want to debug it. The basic      debugging technique for JavaScript is like that in many other      languages--insert statements into your code to print out the value      of relevant variables so that you can try to figure out what is      actually happening. As we've seen, you can sometimes use the      <tt CLASS=literal>document.write()</tt> method to do this. This      method doesn't work from within event handlers, however, and has      some other shortcomings as well, so it's often easier to use      the <tt CLASS=literal>alert()</tt> method to display debugging      messages in a separate dialog box.    <P CLASS=para>      The <tt CLASS=literal>for/in</tt> loop mentioned above is also very      useful when debugging. You can use it, along with the      <tt CLASS=literal>alert()</tt> method to write a function that      displays a list of the names and values of all properties of an      object, for example. This kind of function can be quite handy      when exploring the language or trying to debug code.    <P CLASS=para>      Good luck with JavaScript, and have fun exploring!    </DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch01_08.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch02_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Using the Rest of This Book</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Lexical Structure</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
