It is the    lowest-level syntax of a language, and specifies such things as what    variable names look like, what characters are used for comments, and how    one program statement is separated from the next. This short chapter    explains the lexical structure of JavaScript: it covers the above topics    and others.  <DIV CLASS=sect1><h2 CLASS=sect1><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch02-SECT1-AUTOID.1">2.1 Case Sensitivity</A></h2><P CLASS=para>      JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that language      keywords, variables, function names, and any other identifiers      must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of      letters. The <tt CLASS=literal>while</tt> keyword, for example, must      be typed "while", and not "While" or "WHILE". Similarly,      <tt CLASS=literal>online</tt>, <tt CLASS=literal>Online</tt>,      <tt CLASS=literal>OnLine</tt>, and <tt CLASS=literal>ONLINE</tt> are four      distinct variable names.    <P CLASS=para>      Note that HTML is not case-sensitive, which, because of its close      association with JavaScript, can be confusing. In particular,      names of event handlers[1] are often typed in mixed-case in HTML      (<tt CLASS=literal>onClick</tt> or <tt CLASS=literal>OnClick</tt>, for      example) but must be all lowercase when referenced from JavaScript      (<tt CLASS=literal>onclick</tt>).    <blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[1] 	  Event handlers are pieces of JavaScript code used as the value	  of HTML attributes.	</blockquote><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch02-SECT2-AUTOID.1">Case Sensitivity in Internet Explorer</A></h3><P CLASS=para>	In Internet Explorer 3.0, the core JavaScript language is        case-sensitive, as it is in Navigator. Unfortunately, all of the	objects, and their methods and properties, added to this core	language by client-side JavaScript are case-insensitive in IE.	The Date and Math objects are a built-in part of core	JavaScript, so they are case-sensitive in IE; to compute a sine,	you must invoke <tt CLASS=literal>Math.sin()</tt>, exactly as shown	here. On the other hand, the Document object is part of	client-side JavaScript, so it is not case-sensitive. This means	that where you would type <tt CLASS=literal>document.write()</tt> in	Navigator, you could use <tt CLASS=literal>Document.Write()</tt>,	<tt CLASS=literal>DOCUMENT.WRITE()</tt>, or even	<tt CLASS=literal>DoCuMeNt.WrItE()</tt> in Internet Explorer.      <P CLASS=para>	All user-defined variables, functions, and objects are        case-sensitive in IE; it is just the client-side objects and their	predefined methods and properties that are not. This does	mean, however that you need to be careful how you name your	variables and properties. For example, the Window object has a	property named <tt CLASS=literal>parent</tt>. In Navigator, it	would be perfectly safe to create a new property of a Window	object and name it <tt CLASS=literal>Parent</tt>. This would not be	okay in IE, however, and would either cause an error or	overwrite the value of the <tt CLASS=literal>parent</tt> property.      <P CLASS=para>	The reason that client-side objects are not case-sensitive in IE	is that IE allows the same client-side objects to be used by the	VBScript scripting language. VBScript, like Visual Basic, is not	case-sensitive, so Microsoft felt that their client-side objects	must not be either. Because of Microsoft's requirement for	VBScript, it is not likely that the client-side objects will	become case-sensitive in a future version of IE; this is an	incompatibility that we will have to live with.      <P CLASS=para>	This incompatibility presents a worst-of-both-worlds situation.	Because Navigator is case-sensitive, you must be sure to type	all your object, method, and property names in exactly the	correct case. But because IE is not case-sensitive, you can't	take advantage of Navigator's case sensitivity to create	different variables with the same spelling and different	capitalizations.     </DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch01_09.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch02_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Exploring JavaScript</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Whitespace and Line Breaks</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
