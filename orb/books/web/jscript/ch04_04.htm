These      are operators that compare values of various types and return a      Boolean value (<tt CLASS=literal>true</tt> or      <tt CLASS=literal>false</tt>) depending on the result of the      comparison. As we'll see in <A HREF="ch05_01.htm">Chapter 5, <i>Statements</i></A>, they      are most commonly used in things like <tt CLASS=literal>if</tt>      statements and <tt CLASS=literal>while</tt> loops to control the flow      of program execution.    <DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch04-SECT2-AUTOID.13">Equality (==)</A></h3><P CLASS=para>	The <tt CLASS=literal>==</tt> operator returns	<tt CLASS=literal>true</tt> if its two operands are equal, and	returns <tt CLASS=literal>false</tt> if they are not equal. The	operands may be of any type, and the definition of "equal"	depends on the type.      <P CLASS=para>		In JavaScript, numbers, strings, and Boolean values are compared	<I CLASS=emphasis>by value</I>. This means that two variables are	equal only if they contain the same value. For example, two	strings are equal only if they each contain exactly the same	characters. In this case, there are two separate values	involved, and the <tt CLASS=literal>==</tt> operator checks	that these two values are identical.      <P CLASS=para>	On the other hand, objects and arrays are compared <I CLASS=emphasis>by	reference</I>. This means that two variables are equal	only if they refer to the same object. Two separate arrays will	never be equal, by the definition of the	<tt CLASS=literal>==</tt> operator, even if they contain	identical elements. For two variables that contain references to	objects, arrays, or functions, they are equal only if they refer	to the same object, array, or function. If you want to test that	two separate objects contain the same properties or that two	separate arrays contain the same elements, you'll have to check	the properties and elements yourself. (And, if any of the properties or	elements are themselves objects or arrays, you'll have to decide	which kind of equality you want to test for.)      <P CLASS=para>	In Navigator 3.0, functions are compared by reference, just as	objects and arrays are. Prior to 3.0, functions may not be used	with the <tt CLASS=literal>==</tt> operator.      <P CLASS=para>	Usually, if two values have different types, then they are not	equal. Because JavaScript automatically converts data types when	needed, though, this is not always the case. For example, the	expression <tt CLASS=literal>"1" == 1</tt>	evaluates to <tt CLASS=literal>true</tt> in JavaScript. Similarly,	and not surprisingly to C or C++ programmers, <tt CLASS=literal>true	== 1</tt> and <tt CLASS=literal>false == 0</tt>	are also both <tt CLASS=literal>true</tt> expressions. In Navigator	2.0, <tt CLASS=literal>null</tt> is equal to <tt CLASS=literal>0</tt>,	but this was a bug was fixed in 3.0. Be careful when comparing	values of different types: if you compare a string to a number,	and the string cannot be converted to a number, then Navigator	2.0 and 3.0 will produce an error message. Internet Explorer	takes the simpler, and probably correct, course and returns	<tt CLASS=literal>false</tt> in this case.      <P CLASS=para>	Note that the equality operator <tt CLASS=literal>==</tt> is	very different from the assignment operator	<tt CLASS=literal>=</tt>, although in English, we often read both as	"equals". It is important to keep the two operators distinct and	to use the correct one in the correct situation. To keep them	straight, it may help to read the assignment operator	<tt CLASS=literal>=</tt> as "is assigned" or as "gets".      </DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch04-SECT2-AUTOID.14">Inequality (!=)</A></h3><P CLASS=para>	The <tt CLASS=literal>!=</tt> operator tests for the exact opposite	of the <tt CLASS=literal>==</tt> operator. If two variables	are equal to each other, then comparing them with the	<tt CLASS=literal>!=</tt> operator will return	<tt CLASS=literal>false</tt>. On the other hand, comparing two	objects that are not equal to each other with	<tt CLASS=literal>!=</tt> will return <tt CLASS=literal>true</tt>. As	we'll see, the <tt CLASS=literal>!</tt> operator computes the	Boolean NOT operation. This makes it easy to remember that	<tt CLASS=literal>!=</tt> stands for "not equal to."[1]	See the	discussion of the <tt CLASS=literal>==</tt> operator for	details on how equality is defined for different data types.      <blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[1] 	    There is one case in which the <tt CLASS=literal>!=</tt>	    operator is not the exact opposite of <tt CLASS=literal>==</tt>,	    when <tt CLASS=literal>a != b</tt> is not identical to	    <tt CLASS=literal>!(a == b)</tt>. This occurs with the	    <tt CLASS=literal>NaN</tt> value (Not-a-Number), which is never	    equal or inequal to itself. That is, if either operand is	    <tt CLASS=literal>NaN</tt>, both <tt CLASS=literal>==</tt> and	    <tt CLASS=literal>!=</tt> return <tt CLASS=literal>false</tt>.	  </blockquote></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch04-SECT2-AUTOID.15">Less Than (&lt;)</A></h3><P CLASS=para>	The <tt CLASS=literal>&lt;</tt> operator evaluates to	<tt CLASS=literal>true</tt> if its first operand is less than its	second operand; otherwise it evaluates to	<tt CLASS=literal>false</tt>.
