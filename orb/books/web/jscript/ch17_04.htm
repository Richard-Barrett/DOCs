When a      form is submitted, the user's input data is passed to the web      server in the form of name/value pairs, and these properties      specify the name under which each element's data is submitted      and the value that is submitted for that element. The name      property is a read-only string; its value is specified by the      <tt CLASS=literal>NAME</tt> attribute of the HTML tag that defined      the form element. This <tt CLASS=literal>NAME</tt> attribute is      optional, but data from an element cannot be submitted unless a      it is specified. In the next subsection, we'll see another use      of the <tt CLASS=literal>NAME</tt> attribute.    <P CLASS=para>      The <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property is similar to the      <tt CLASS=literal>name</tt> property. This property is a read/write      string for all form element objects, and it contains the data      that is transferred over the network when the form is submitted.      The initial value of the <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property is,      logically enough, usually specified by the      <tt CLASS=literal>VALUE</tt> attribute of the HTML tag that defined      the form element. For some objects, however, the initial      <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> is specified in some other way.    <P CLASS=para>      The <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property contains a string value for      all form elements. Because of the automatic data conversion      performed by Navigator, you can assign a value or object of any      type to the <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property and it will      automatically be converted to a string. Unfortunately, a      limitation in Internet Explorer 3.0 does not allow objects to be      assigned to the <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property. In order to do      this you must explicitly convert the object to a string; you      cannot rely on automatic conversion as you can with Navigator.      Thus, if you wanted to display the current date and time in an      input field of a form, the following code would not work in IE 3.0:      <DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>today = new Date();document.myform.date.value = today;</PRE></DIV>      The easiest way to explicitly convert the <tt CLASS=literal>today</tt>      object to a string is to add it to the empty string, so the      following code would work in IE 3.0:      <DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>today = new Date();document.myform.date.value = "" + today;</PRE></DIV>    <P CLASS=para>      Not all uses of the <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property are      obvious at the first glance. For Text and TextArea objects, the      <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property is simply the string contained      in the input field. Setting the <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt>      property of these objects changes the text that those input      fields display. For Button, Reset, and Submit objects, however,      the <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property contains is the text that      is displayed by the push-button. Although the property is      read/write, changing it will not change the text that appears in      the button (at least not on all platforms). Also, the      <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> of Button and Reset objects is never      actually submitted with the form that contains them. (The value      of a Submit object is submitted only when that Submit object was      the one that caused the form to be submitted--this allows a CGI      script to determine how the form was submitted in cases where      there is more than one way to do so.)    <P CLASS=para>      The <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property for Checkbox and Radio      objects is also a little bit tricky. Since these objects      represent toggle buttons in an HTML form, you might expect their      <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property to indicate the state of the      button--i.e., to be a Boolean value that indicates whether the      toggle button is checked or not. In fact, though, it is the      <tt CLASS=literal>checked</tt> property of these objects that      indicates what state they are in. The <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt>      property, as always, is the string value that is submitted with      the form if the Checkbox or Radio object is checked when the      form is submitted. It should be set to some string that is      meaningful to the CGI script that will receive the form      submission.     <P CLASS=para><A NAME="CH17.SELECT1"></A><A NAME="CH17.SELECT2"></A>      The Select object is another unusual case. It displays a list      or drop-down menu of options and allows the user to select one      or more of them. These options are not specified by the      <tt CLASS=literal>&lt;SELECT&gt;</tt> tag, but by a separate      <tt CLASS=literal>&lt;OPTION&gt;</tt> tag, so it turns out that the      Select object actually has no <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property,      and is an exception to the rule above that all form element      objects have a property by this name. Since the      <tt CLASS=literal>VALUE</tt> attribute belongs to the      <tt CLASS=literal>&lt;OPTION&gt;</tt> tag, the      <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property belongs to the Option object.      Now, you might expect that, like the Text and Button objects,      the <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property of the Option object would      specify the text that is displayed to the user in the list or      drop-down menu. In fact, though, this is not how it is done.      The text displayed for an Option is meant to be a verbose,      human-readable string, and this is not ideal for processing by a      CGI script. The <tt CLASS=literal>text</tt> property of the Option      object specifies the string that the user sees, and the      <tt CLASS=literal>value</tt> property specifies the (usually terser)      string submitted if the option is selected when the form is      submitted.    <DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch17-SECT2-AUTOID.1">The Select and Option objects</A></h3><P CLASS=para>	While we are discussing the Select and Option objects, it should	be noted that these differ in a number of ways form other form	element objects. First, note that the Option object is not	itself a form element--it is an object contained by a Select	object. The Select object is the only form element object that	contains other objects. They are contained in its	<tt CLASS=literal>options[]</tt> array, so you may end up referring	to individual Option objects with very long expressions like the	following:	<DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>document.forms[0].elements[1].options[2]</PRE></DIV>      <P CLASS=para>	The second unique feature of the Option object is that, in	Navigator 3.0, they can be dynamically created at run-time.	Option objects are created with the <tt CLASS=literal>Option()</tt>	constructor function, and can be added to the	<tt CLASS=literal>options[]</tt> array of a Select object by simple	assignment. This <tt CLASS=literal>options[]</tt> property has	several special behaviors itself--if you decrease the value of	<tt CLASS=literal>options.length</tt> options will be deleted	from the end of the list or drop-down menu displayed by the	Select object. Similarly, if you set one of the entries in the	<tt CLASS=literal>options[]</tt> array to <tt CLASS=literal>null</tt>,	that option will be removed from the list or menu, and the	elements following it in the array will be moved down one to	fill up the newly vacated array element. For full details, see	the Select and Option objects, and their properties in the	reference section of this book.      </DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch17_03.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch17_05.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Form Elements</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Naming Forms and Form Elements</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
