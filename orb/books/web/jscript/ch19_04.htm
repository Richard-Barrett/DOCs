But there is more to be discussed. It has to do      with how JavaScript converts JavaObjects to various JavaScript      primitive types. Notice in <A HREF="ch19_03.htm#JSCRIPT-CH-LIVECONN-FIG-3">Figure 19-3</A> that quite a few Java data      types, including Java strings (instances of      <I CLASS=emphasis>java.lang.String</I>) are converted to JavaObject      objects in JavaScript rather than being converted to actual      JavaScript primitive types, such as strings. This means that when      you use LiveConnect, you'll commonly be working with JavaObject      objects.    <P CLASS=para>      Refer back to <A HREF="ch09_01.htm#JSCRIPT-CH-FURTHER-TAB-CONVERSION">Table 9.1</A>.  You may also want      to re-read the section of <A HREF="ch09_01.htm">Chapter 9, <i>Further Topics in JavaScript</i></A>,      that <A HREF="ch09_01.htm#JSCRIPT-CH-FURTHER-TAB-CONVERSION">Table 9.1</A> is      contained in.  The table shows how various JavaScript data types      are converted when used in various "contexts." For example, when      a number is used in a string context, it is converted to a      string. And when an object is used in a Boolean context, it is      converted to the value <tt CLASS=literal>false</tt> if it is      <tt CLASS=literal>null</tt> and <tt CLASS=literal>true</tt>      otherwise. These conversion rules don't apply to JavaObject      objects. JavaObject objects are converted using their own rules,      as follows:      <P><UL CLASS=itemizedlist><li CLASS=listitem>	    When a JavaObject is used in a numeric context, it is	    converted to a number by invoking the	    <tt CLASS=literal>doubleValue()</tt> method of the Java object	    it represents. If the Java object does not define this	    method, a JavaScript error occurs.	  <P><li CLASS=listitem>	    When a JavaObject is used in a Boolean context, it is	    converted to a Boolean value by invoking the	    <tt CLASS=literal>booleanValue()</tt> method of the Java object	    it represents. If the Java object does not define this	    method, a JavaScript error occurs.	  <P><li CLASS=listitem>	    When a JavaObject is used in a string context, it is	    converted to a string value by invoking the	    <tt CLASS=literal>toString()</tt> method of the Java object it	    represents. All Java objects define or inherit this method,	    so this conversion always succeeds.	  <P><li CLASS=listitem>	    When a JavaObject is used in a function context, a	    JavaScript error occurs.	  <P><li CLASS=listitem>	    When a JavaObject is used in an object context, no	    conversion is necessary, since it is already a JavaScript	    object.	  <P></UL>    <P CLASS=para>      Because of these different conversion rules, and for other reasons      as well, JavaObjects behave differently than other JavaScript      objects, and there are some common pitfalls that you need to      beware of. First, it is not uncommon to work with a JavaObject      that represents an instance of a      <I CLASS=emphasis>java.lang.Double</I> or some other numeric      object. In many ways, such a JavaObject will behave like a      primitive number value, but be careful when using the      <tt CLASS=literal>+</tt> operator. When you use a JavaObject (or any      JavaScript object) with <tt CLASS=literal>+</tt>, it constitutes a      string context, and the object is converted to a string for string      concatenation, instead of being converted to a number for      addition.    <P CLASS=para>      When we described this same problem above when working with a      Number object, we said that the workaround was to explicitly call      <tt CLASS=literal>valueOf()</tt> to convert the Number to a primitive      number. Because of another difference between JavaObjects and      other JavaScript objects, this workaround doesn't work in this      case. Recall that the JavaObject object has no properties of its      own; all of its properties represent fields and methods of the      Java object it represents. This means that JavaObjects don't even      have the <tt CLASS=literal>valueOf()</tt> method recommended above!      So when you've got a JavaObject representing an instance of      <I CLASS=emphasis>java.lang.Double</I>, or something similar,      you'll have to call the <tt CLASS=literal>doubleValue()</tt> method      when you need to force it to a primitive value.    <P CLASS=para>      Another difference between JavaObjects and other JavaScript data      types is that JavaObjects can only be used in a Boolean context if      they define a <tt CLASS=literal>booleanValue()</tt> method. Suppose      <tt CLASS=literal>button</tt> is a JavaScript variable that may      contain <tt CLASS=literal>null</tt> or may hold a JavaObject that      represents an instance of the <I CLASS=emphasis>java.awt.Button</I>      class. If you want to check whether the variable contains      <tt CLASS=literal>null</tt>, you might write code like this, out of      old habit:      <DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>if (!button) { ... }</PRE></DIV>      If <tt CLASS=literal>button</tt> is <tt CLASS=literal>null</tt>, this will      work fine. But if <tt CLASS=literal>button</tt> actually contains a      JavaObject representing a <I CLASS=emphasis>java.awt.Button</I>      instance, then LiveConnect will try to invoke the      <tt CLASS=literal>booleanValue()</tt> method. When it discovers that      the <I CLASS=emphasis>java.awt.Button</I> class doesn't define one,      it will cause a JavaScript error. The workaround in this case is      to be explicit about what you are testing for, to avoid using the      JavaObject in a Boolean context:      <DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>if (button != null) { ... }</PRE></DIV>      This is a good habit to get into, in any case, since it makes your      code easier to read and understand.    </DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch19_03.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch19_05.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>LiveConnect Data Conversion</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Scripting Java with JavaScript</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
