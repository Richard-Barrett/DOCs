Since the top-level manpage is simply called<I CLASS=emphasis>perl</I>, the UNIX command "<tt CLASS=literal>man perl</tt>"should take you to it.[1]That page in turn directs you to more specific pages.  For example,"<tt CLASS=literal>man perlre</tt>"will display the manpage for Perl's regular expressions.The <tt CLASS=literal>perldoc</tt> command maywork when the <I CLASS=emphasis>man</I> (1) command won't, especially on moduledocumentation that your system administrator may not have feltcomfortable installing with the ordinary manpages.On the other hand, your system administrator may have installed the Perldocumentation in hypertext markup language (HTML) format.<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[1] If you still get a humongous page when you do that, you're probablypicking up the ancient Release 4 manpage.  Check your MANPATH forarcheological sites.</blockquote></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="PERL2-PREFACE-SECT-3.2">Usenet Newsgroups</A></h3><P CLASS=para>The Perl newsgroups are a great, if sometimes cluttered, source of informationabout Perl.  comp.lang.perl.announceis a moderated, low-traffic newsgroupfor Perl-related announcements.  These often deal with new version releases,bug fixes, new extensions and modules, and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).<P CLASS=para>The high-traffic <I CLASS=emphasis>comp.lang.perl.misc</I> group discusses everything fromtechnical issues to Perl philosophy to Perl games and Perl poetry.  Like Perlitself, <I CLASS=emphasis>comp.lang.perl.misc</I>is meant to be useful, and no question is toosilly to ask.[2]<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[2] Of course, some questions are too sillyto answer, especially those already answered in the FAQ.</blockquote><P CLASS=para>The <I CLASS=emphasis>comp.lang.perl.tk</I> group discusses how to use the popular Tk toolkitfrom Perl.The <I CLASS=emphasis>comp.lang.perl.modules</I> group is about the development and use of Perlmodules, which are the best way to get reusable code.  There may be other<I CLASS=emphasis>comp.lang.perl.whatever</I> newsgroups by the time you read this; lookaround.<P CLASS=para>One other newsgroup you might want to check out, at least if you're doingCGI programming on the Web, is <I CLASS=emphasis>comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi</I>.While it isn't strictly speaking a Perl group, most of the programsdiscussed there are written in Perl.  It's the right place to go forWeb-related Perl issues.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="PERL2-PREFACE-SECT-3.3">The Perl Homepage</A></h3><P CLASS=para>If you have access to the World Wide Web, visitthe Perl homepage at <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/perl/">http://www.perl.com/perl/</A>.It tells what's new in the Perl world, and contains source code and ports,documentation, third-party modules, the Perl bugs database, mailing listinformation, and more.  This site also provides the CPAN multiplexer,described later.<P CLASS=para>Also check out <A HREF="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</A>, which is the homepage of the Perl Institute,a non-profit organization dedicated to saving the world through servingthe Perl community.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="PERL2-PREFACE-SECT-3.4">Frequently Asked Questions List</A></h3><P CLASS=para>The Perl Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) is a collection of questions andanswers that often show up on comp.lang.perl.misc.  In many respects itis a companion to the available books, explaining concepts that peoplemay not have understood and maintaining up-to-date information about suchthings as the latest release level and the best place to get the Perlsource.<P CLASS=para>There is also a metaFAQ, which answers supercommon questions.  It haspointers to the current Perl distribution, various non-UNIX ports, andthe full FAQ.  There may be other FAQs you will find useful--for example,FAQs about non-UNIX ports, Web programming, or perltk.<P CLASS=para>Another FAQish sort of posting is the Perl Modules List, which keepstrack of all the various existing and proposed modules that variousfolks have worked on, or will work on someday real soon now.  Includedare the email addresses of people to bug, and much free advice on moduledesign.  A must-read for people who don't want to reinvent either thebuggy whip or the wheel.<P CLASS=para>The FAQs are periodically posted to comp.lang.perl.announce, and can alsobe found on the web at <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/perl&nbsp;/faq">http://www.perl.com/perl&nbsp;/faq</A>.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="PERL2-PREFACE-SECT-3.5">Bug Reports</A></h3><P CLASS=para>In the unlikely event that you should encounter a bug that's in Perl proper andnot just in your own program, you should try to reduce it to a minimal test caseand then report it with the <I CLASS=emphasis>perlbug</I> program that comes with Perl.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="PERL2-PREFACE-SECT-3.6">The Perl Distribution</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Perl is distributed under either of two licenses (your choice).  Thefirst is the standard GNU Copyleft, which means briefly that if youcan execute Perl on your system, you should have access to the fullsource of Perl for no additional charge.  Alternately, Perl may also bedistributed under the Artistic License, which some people find lessthreatening than the Copyleft (especially lawyers).<P CLASS=para>Within the Perl distribution, you will find some exampleprograms in the <I CLASS=emphasis>eg/</I> directory.  You may also find other tidbits.Poke around in there on some rainy afternoon.  Study the Perl source(if you're a C hacker with a masochistic streak).  Look at the testsuite.  See how <I CLASS=emphasis>Configure</I> determines whether you have the <I CLASS=emphasis>mkdir</I> (2)system call.  Figure out how Perl does dynamic loading of C modules.Or whatever else suits your fancy.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="PERL2-PREFACE-SECT-3.7">Other Books</A></h3><P CLASS=para><I CLASS=emphasis>Learning Perl</I>by Randal Schwartz (published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates) is a companionto <I CLASS=emphasis>Programming Perl</I>.  It is more of a tutorial, whereas this bookis more of a reference.  If the tutorial section of <I CLASS=emphasis>Programming Perl</I>is too short or assumes too much about your background, try <I CLASS=emphasis>LearningPerl</I> for a kinder, gentler introduction to the language.  If you want tolearn more about Perl's regular expressions, we suggest <I CLASS=emphasis>MasteringRegular Expressions</I>, by Jeffrey E.F. Friedl (also published byO'Reilly &amp; Associates).<P CLASS=para><I CLASS=emphasis>The AWK Programming Language</I>, by Aho, Kernighan, and Weinberger(published by Addison-Wesley), and <I CLASS=emphasis>sed &amp; awk</I>, by Dale Dougherty(published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates), provide anessential background in such things as associative arrays, regularexpressions, and the general worldview that gave rise to Perl.  They alsocontain many examples that can be translated into Perl by the awk-to-perltranslator <I CLASS=emphasis>a2p</I> or by the sed-to-perl translator <I CLASS=emphasis>s2p</I>.  Thesetranslators won't produce idiomatic Perl, of course, but if you can'tfigure out how to imitate one of those examples in Perl, the translatoroutput will give you a good place to start.<P CLASS=para>We also recommend Johan Vromans's convenient and thorough quickreference booklet, called <I CLASS=emphasis>Perl 5 Desktop Reference</I>, publishedcoincidentally by O'Reilly &amp; Associates.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch00_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif"     ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch00_04.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif"     ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>The Rest of This Book</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>How to Get Perl</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
