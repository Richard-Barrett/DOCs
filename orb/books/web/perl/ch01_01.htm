One thing that's easy about Perl is thatyou don't have to say much before you say what you want to say.  In manyprogramming languages, you have to declare the types, variables, andsubroutines you are going to use before you can write the firststatement of executable code.  And for complex problems demandingcomplex data structures, this is a good idea.  But for many simple,everyday problems, you would like a programming language in which youcan simply say:<P CLASS=para><DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>print "Howdy, world!\n";</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>and expect the program to do just that.<P CLASS=para>Perl is such a language.  In fact, the example is a complete program,[1]and if you feed it to the Perl interpreter, it will print "<tt CLASS=literal>Howdy,world!</tt>" on your screen.<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[1] Or script, or application, or executable, or doohickey.  Whatever.</blockquote><P CLASS=para>And that's that.  You don't have to say much<I CLASS=emphasis>after</I> you say what you want to say, either.Unlike many languages, Perl thinks that falling off the end of yourprogram is just a normal way to exit the program.  You certainly<I CLASS=emphasis>may</I> call the <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-EXIT">exit</A>function explicitly if you wish, just as you <I CLASS=emphasis>may</I>declare some of your variables and subroutines, or even<I CLASS=emphasis>force</I> yourself to declare all your variables andsubroutines.  But it's your choice.  With Perl you're free to do TheRight Thing, however you care to define it.<P CLASS=para>There are many other reasons why Perl is easy to use, but it would bepointless to list them all here, because that's what the rest of thebook is for.  The devil may be in the details, as they say, but Perltries to help you out down there in the hot place too.  At every level,Perl is about helping you get from here to there with minimum fuss andmaximum enjoyment.  That's why so many Perl programmers go around witha silly grin on their face.<P CLASS=para>This chapter is an overview of Perl, so we're not trying to present Perlto the rational side of your brain.  Nor are we trying to be complete, orlogical.  That's what the next chapter is for.[2]This chapter presents Perl to the <I CLASS=emphasis>other</I> side of your brain, whetheryou prefer to call it associative, artistic, passionate, or merelyspongy.  To that end, we'll be presenting various views of Perl thatwill hopefully give you as clear a picture of Perl as the blind men hadof the elephant.  Well, okay, maybe we can do better than that.We're dealing with a camel here.  Hopefully, at least one of theseviews of Perl will help get you over the hump.<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[2] Vulcans (and like-minded humans) should skip this overview and gostraight to <A HREF="ch02_01.htm">Chapter 2, <i>The Gory Details</i></A>, for maximum information density.  If, onthe other hand, you're looking for a carefully paced tutorial, youshould probably get Randal's nice book, <I CLASS=emphasis>LearningPerl</I> (published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates).  But don't throw out this book just yet.</blockquote></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch00_07.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif"     ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch01_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif"     ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>We'd Like to Hear from You</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Natural and Artificial Languages</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
