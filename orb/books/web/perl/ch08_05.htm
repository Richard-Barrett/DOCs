Specific installation instructions come inthe <I CLASS=emphasis>README</I> file of the Perl distribution kit.Typically, you'll get the Perl kit either as a<I CLASS=emphasis>tar</I> file or as a set of <I CLASS=emphasis>shar</I>(shell archive) scripts.[4] A <I CLASS=emphasis>.Z</I> extensionindicates you need to <I CLASS=emphasis>uncompress</I> the file first.A <I CLASS=emphasis>.gz</I> extension indicates you need to<I CLASS=emphasis>gunzip</I> the file first.  You then unpack the fileas appropriate, read the <I CLASS=emphasis>README</I> file and run amassive shell script called <I CLASS=emphasis>Configure</I>,which tries tofigure out everything about your system.  After this is done, you do aseries of "makes" to find header file dependencies, to compilePerl (and <I CLASS=emphasis>a2p</I>), to run regression tests, and toinstall Perl in your system directories.<blockquote class=footnote><P CLASS=para>[4]  Operating systems other thanUNIX may have special instructions, in which case you should followthem instead of what's in this section.  Look for a file named<I CLASS=emphasis>README.xxx</I>, where <I CLASS=emphasis>xxx</I> isyour OS name.  </blockquote><P CLASS=para>It's possible you'll get a copy of Perl that is already compiled.You'll have to make sure you get <I CLASS=emphasis>suidperl</I>,<I CLASS=emphasis>a2p</I>, and <I CLASS=emphasis>s2p</I> as well, and thePerl library routines (see <A HREF="ch07_01.htm">Chapter 7, <i>The Standard Perl Library</i></A>).  Installthese files in the directories that your version was compiled for.Note: binary distributions of Perl are made available because they'rehandy, not because you are restricted from getting the source andcompiling it yourself.  The people who give you the binarydistribution ought to provide you with some form of access to thesource, if only a pointer to where <I CLASS=emphasis>they</I> got thesource from.  See the <I CLASS=emphasis>Copying</I> file in thedistribution for more information.  <DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="PERL2-CH-8-SECT-5.1">Translation from Awk and Sed</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Along with the Perl distribution come three translators:<I CLASS=emphasis>a2p</I>, which translates <I CLASS=emphasis>awk</I> (1)(not necessarily <I CLASS=emphasis>nawk</I> (1)) scripts to Perl;<I CLASS=emphasis>s2p</I>, which translates <I CLASS=emphasis>sed</I> (1)scripts to Perl; and <I CLASS=emphasis>find2perl</I>, which translates<I CLASS=emphasis>find</I> (1) commands to Perl.These translators don't necessarily produce idiomatic Perl, but youcan use the output as a starting place.  The translators can also helpyou see how the features of other languages map into those of Perl.<P CLASS=para>The <I CLASS=emphasis>a2p</I> translator is written in C, so it iscompiled and installed automatically along with Perl.  The<I CLASS=emphasis>s2p</I> and <I CLASS=emphasis>find2perl</I>translators are themselves written in Perl, so no further compilationis necessary.  They are installed automatically when Perl isinstalled.  They are described more fully in <A HREF="ch06_01.htm">Chapter 6, <i>Social Engineering</i></A>.</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="PERL2-CH-8-SECT-5.2">Examples</A></h3><P CLASS=para>The Perl source distribution comes with some sample scripts in the<I CLASS=emphasis>eg/</I> subdirectory.  Feel free to browse among them and use them.  Theyare not installed automatically, however, so you'll need to copy them tothe appropriate directory, and possibly fix the <tt CLASS=literal>#!</tt> line to point tothe right interpreter.<P CLASS=para>The files in the <I CLASS=emphasis>t/</I> and <I CLASS=emphasis>lib/</I> subdirectories, although incrediblyarcane in spots, can also serve as examples.<P CLASS=para>The examples in this book are also available for anonymous FTP from<I CLASS=emphasis>ftp.ora.com</I> and the <I CLASS=emphasis>scripts</I> subdirectory of CPAN.  (See the Preface for more information about CPAN.)</DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="PERL2-CH-8-SECT-5.3">Patches</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Since Perl is constantly being honed and improved, Larry occasionally postspatches through CPAN.  Your distribution is likely to have had most ofthe patches applied already--check the output of <I CLASS=emphasis>perl -v</I> to seethe current patchlevel of your distribution.<P CLASS=para>Bug reports may be reported by invoking the <I CLASS=emphasis>perlbug</I> command,included with the Perl distribution.<P CLASS=para>Patches are sent out with complete instructions on how to apply them.You'll want to have the <I CLASS=emphasis>patch</I>program handy. (This program was written in self-defense by Larry when hecouldn't persuade people to apply (in order and by hand) all his <I CLASS=emphasis>rn</I>patches, resulting in cascading chaotic catastrophes around the world.)  The<I CLASS=emphasis>patch</I> program is available from the GNU project, because they havetaken over the maintenance (the patching of <I CLASS=emphasis>patch</I>, how quaint) afterLarry got a little more busy with Perl.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch08_04.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif"     ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch08_06.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif"     ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Programming with Style</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Perl Poetry</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
