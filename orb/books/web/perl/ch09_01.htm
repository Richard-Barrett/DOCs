Warnings may be captured by setting<tt CLASS=literal>$SIG{_ _WARN_ _}</tt> to a reference to a routinethat will be called on each warning before printing it.  Trappable errors may betrapped using <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-EVAL">eval</A>.  You can also capturecontrol before a trappable error "dies" by setting<tt CLASS=literal>$SIG{_ _DIE_ _}</tt> to a subroutine reference, butif you don't call <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-DIE">die</A> within that handler,the fatal exception is still thrown when you return from it.  In other words,you're not allowed to "de-fatalize" an exception that way.  You must use an<A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-EVAL">eval</A> wrapper for that.<P CLASS=para>In the following messages <I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I> stands for aninterpolated string that is determined only when the message isgenerated.  (Similarly, <I CLASS=emphasis>%d</I> stands for aninterpolated number--think <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-PRINTF">printf</A>formats, but we use <I CLASS=emphasis>%d</I> to mean a number in anybase here.)  Note that some messages begin with<I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I> --which means that listing themalphabetically is problematical.  You should search among thesemessages if the one you are looking for does not appear in theexpected place.  The symbols<tt CLASS=literal>" % - ? @</tt> sort beforealphabetic characters, while <tt CLASS=literal>[</tt> and<tt CLASS=literal>\</tt> sort after.<P CLASS=para>References of the form, "See <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-UNPACK">unpack</A>,"refer to entries in <A HREF="ch03_01.htm">Chapter 3, <i>Functions</i></A>.<P CLASS=para>If you decide a bug is a Perl bug and not your bug, you should try toreduce it to a minimal test case and then report it with the<I CLASS=emphasis>perlbug</I> program that comes with Perl.<P><DL CLASS=variablelist><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>`my` variable </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> can't be in a package</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make senseto try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.

If itsees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an operator,it gives you this warning.  Usually it indicates that an operator ordelimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> had compilation errors.</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) The final summary message when a <I CLASS=emphasis>perl -c</I> command fails.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> has too many errors.</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.Further error messages would likely be uninformative.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> matches null string many times</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) The pattern you've specified would be an infinite loop if theregular expression engine didn't specifically check for that.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> never introduced</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(S) The symbol in question was declared but somehow went out of scopebefore it could possibly have been used.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> syntax OK</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) The final summary message when a <I CLASS=emphasis>perl -c</I> command succeeds.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>: Command not found.</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <I CLASS=emphasis>csh</I> insteadof <I CLASS=emphasis>perl</I>.

See <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-PACK">pack</A>.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>accept() on closed fd</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) You tried to do an <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-ACCEPT">accept</A> on a closed socket.  Did you forget to checkthe return value of your <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-SOCKET">socket</A> call?  See <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-ACCEPT">accept</A>.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Allocation too large: </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%d</I><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Arg too short for msgsnd</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-MSGSND">msgsnd</A> requires a string at least aslong as <tt CLASS=literal>sizeof(long)</tt>.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Ambiguous use of </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> resolved as </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><DD><P CLASS=para>(W)(S) You said something that may not be interpreted the wayyou thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplyinga missing quote, operator, pair of parentheses, or declaration.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Args must match #! line</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) The setuid emulator requires that the switches <I CLASS=emphasis>perl</I> was invokedwith match the switches specified on the <tt CLASS=literal>#!</tt> line.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Argument `</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>` isn't numeric</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator thatexpected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the messagewill identify which operator was so unfortunate.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Array @</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> missing the @ in argument </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%d</I><tt CLASS=literal> of </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>()</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(D) Really old Perl let you omit the <tt CLASS=literal>@</tt> on array names in somespots.  This is now heavily deprecated.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>assertion botched: </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><DD><P CLASS=para>(P) The <I CLASS=emphasis>malloc</I> (3) package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Assertion failed: file `</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>`</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(P) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Assignment to both a list and a scalar</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the second and third argumentsmust either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won'tknow which context to supply to the right side.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Attempt to free non-arena SV: </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%d</I><DD><P CLASS=para>(P) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas that willbe garbage collected upon exit.  An SV was discovered to be outside anyof those arenas.  This probably means that someone screwed up in a Cextension module.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Attempt to free temp prematurely</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the internal<tt CLASS=literal>free_tmps()</tt> routine.  This indicates that something else isfreeing the SV before the <tt CLASS=literal>free_tmps()</tt> routine gets a chance, whichmeans that the <tt CLASS=literal>free_tmps()</tt> routine will be freeing an unreferencedscalar when it does try to free it.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(P) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if itwould go to <tt CLASS=literal>0</tt>, and discovered that it had already gone to<tt CLASS=literal>0</tt> earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably wasfreed.  This could indicate that <tt CLASS=literal>SvREFCNT_dec()</tt>was called toomany times, or that <tt CLASS=literal>SvREFCNT_inc()</tt> was called too few times, orthat the SV was mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memoryhas been corrupted.  In any event, it's likely a problem with the Cextension module you're developing.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Bad arg length for </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>, is </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%d</I><tt CLASS=literal>, should be </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%d</I><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-MSGCTL">msgctl</A>,<A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-SEMCTL">semctl</A> or <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-SHMCTL">shmctl</A>.  In C parlance, the correct sizes are<tt CLASS=literal>sizeof(struct msqid_ds *)</tt>, <tt CLASS=literal>sizeof(struct semid_ds *)</tt> and<tt CLASS=literal>sizeof(struct shmid_ds *)</tt>, respectively.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Bad associative array</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Bad filehandle: </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the symbolhas no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-OPEN">open</A>, ordid it in another package.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Bad free() ignored</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(S) An internal routine called <I CLASS=emphasis>free</I> (3) on something that had never been<I CLASS=emphasis>malloc</I> (3)ed in the first place.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Bad name after </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>::</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then didn'tfinish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside of quotes,so<DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>$var = 'myvar';$sym = mypack::$var;</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>is not the same as<DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>$var = 'myvar';$sym = "mypack::$var";</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para><p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Bad symbol for array</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to something thatwasn't a symbol table entry.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Bad symbol for filehandle</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to something thatwasn't a symbol table entry.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Bad symbol for hash</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something thatwasn't a symbol table entry.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Badly placed ()'s</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <I CLASS=emphasis>csh</I> insteadof <I CLASS=emphasis>perl</I>.  Check the <tt CLASS=literal>#!</tt> line, or manuallyfeed your script into <I CLASS=emphasis>perl</I> yourself.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>BEGIN failed- -compilation aborted</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN subroutine.Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is exited.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>bind() on closed fd</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) You tried to do a <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-BIND">bind</A> on a closed socket.  Did you forget to checkthe return value of your <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-SOCKET">socket</A> call?  See <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-BIND">bind</A>.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Bizarre copy of </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> in </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><DD><P CLASS=para>(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value that is not copiable.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Callback called exit</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via <tt CLASS=literal>perl_call_sv()</tt>exited by calling <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-EXIT">exit</A>.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't `last` outside a block</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) A <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-LAST">last</A> statement was executed to break out of the current block,except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't acurrent block.  See note on the next entry.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't `next` outside a block</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) A <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-NEXT">next</A> statement was executed toreiterate the current block, but there isn't a current block.  Note that an <B>if</B> or<B>else</B> block doesn't count as a "loopish" block.  You can usually double the curly brackets to getthe same effect though, since the inner brackets will be considered a blockthat loops once.  See <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-LAST">last</A>.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't `redo` outside a block</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) A <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-REDO">redo</A> statement was executed to restart the current block, butthere isn't a current block.  See note on the previous entry.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't bless non-reference value</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) Only hard references may be blessed.  This is how Perl "enforces"encapsulation of objects.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't break at that line</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(S) A debugger warning indicatingthe line number specified wasn't the location of a statement that couldbe stopped at.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't call method `</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>` in empty package `</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>`</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a packagefunctioning as a class, but that package doesn't have anything at alldefined in it, let alone methods.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't call method `</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>` on unblessed reference</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) A method call must know what package it's supposed to run in.  Itordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, butyou didn't supply an object reference in this case.  A reference isn'tan object reference until it has been blessed.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't call method `</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>` without a package or object reference</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by theobject reference or package name contains an expression that returnsneither an object reference nor a package name.  (Perhaps it's null?)Something like this will reproduce the error:<DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>$BADREF = undef;process $BADREF 1,2,3;$BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para><p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't chdir to </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) You called <tt CLASS=literal>perl -x/foo/bar</tt>, but<I CLASS=emphasis>/foo/bar</I> is not a directory that you can<I CLASS=emphasis>chdir</I>&nbsp;(2) to, possibly because it doesn't exist.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't coerce </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> to integer in </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries(type GLOB), can't be forced to stop being what they are.

Typical reasons include: the permissionswere wrong on the file, the file wasn't found in <tt CLASS=literal>$ENV{PATH}</tt>, theexecutable in question was compiled for another architecture, or the<tt CLASS=literal>#!</tt> line in a script points to an interpreter that can't be run forsimilar reasons.

This arises because of the difference betweenaccess checks under VMS and under the UNIX model Perl assumes.  Under VMS,access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the stat buffer, sothat ACLs and other protections can be taken into account.  Unfortunately, Perlassumes that the stat buffer contains all the necessary information, and passesit, instead of the filespec, to the access-checking routine.  It will try toretrieve the filespec using the device name and FID present in the stat buffer,but this works only if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL<tt CLASS=literal>stat</tt>routine, since the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warningappears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up andreturned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access-checking routineknows about the Perl <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-STAT">stat</A> operator and file tests, so you shouldn't eversee this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internalcode takes stat buffers lightly.)<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't get pipe mailbox device name</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.

You mentioned <B>$a</B> or <B>$b</B> in the same line as the<tt CLASS=literal>&lt;=&gt;</tt> or <B>cmp</B> operator,and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename thelexical variable.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't use </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> for loop variable</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) Only a simple scalar variable may be used as a loop variable on a<B>foreach</B>.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Can't use </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> ref as </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> ref</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) You've mixed up your reference types.  You have to dereference areference of the type needed.

The difference is that<tt CLASS=literal>$foo[&amp;bar]</tt> always behaves like a scalar, both when assigning toit and when evaluating its argument, while <tt CLASS=literal>@foo[&amp;bar]</tt> behaveslike a list when you assign to it, and provides a list context to itssubscript, which can do weird things if you're only expecting onesubscript.On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the arrayelement as a list, you need to look into how references work, sincePerl will not magically convert between scalars and lists for you.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Script is not setuid/setgid in suidperl</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) Oddly, the <I CLASS=emphasis>suidperl</I> program was invoked on a script with its setuidor setgid bit unset.

This usually means there's a better way to do it in Perl.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Use of </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> is deprecated</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(D) The construct indicated is no longer recommended for use, generallybecause there's a better way to do it, and also because the old way hasbad side effects.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Use of bare &lt;&lt; to mean &lt;&lt;`` is deprecated</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(D) You are now encouraged to use the explicitly quoted form if youwish to use a blank line as the terminator of the here-document.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Use of implicit split to @_ is deprecated</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(D) It makes a lot of work for the compiler when you clobber asubroutine's argument list, so it's better if you assign the results ofa <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-SPLIT">split</A> explicitly to an array (or list).<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Use of uninitialized value</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) An undefined value was used as if it were already defined.  It wasinterpreted as a <tt CLASS=literal>""</tt> or a <tt CLASS=literal>0</tt>, but maybe it was a mistake.To suppress this warning, assign an initial value to your variables.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Useless use of </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> in void context</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) You did something without a side effect in a context that does nothingwith the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a valuefrom a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very oftenthis points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to parseyour program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd get thisif you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and said<DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>$one, $two = 1, 2;</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>when you meant to say<DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>($one, $two) = (1, 2);</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a listreference when you should be using square or curly brackets, forexample, if you say<DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>$array = (1,2);</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>when you should have said<DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>$array = [1,2];</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated ina scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, whichthrows away the left argument, which is not what you want.<DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Variable `</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>` is not exported</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) While <tt CLASS=literal>use strict</tt> in effect, you referred to a global variablethat you thought was imported from another module, becausesomething else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exportedby that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny characteron the front of your variable.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Variable name `</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>::</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>` used only once: possible typo</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) Typographical errors often show up as unique names.  If youhad a good reason for having a unique name, then just mention itagain somehow to suppress the message.  You might consider declaringthe variable with <tt CLASS=literal>use vars</tt>.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Variable syntax.</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <I CLASS=emphasis>csh</I> insteadof <I CLASS=emphasis>perl</I>.  Check the <tt CLASS=literal>#!</tt> line, or manually feed your scriptinto <I CLASS=emphasis>perl</I> yourself.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Warning: unable to close filehandle </tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal> properly.</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(S) The implicit <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-CLOSE">close</A> done by an <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-OPEN">open</A> got an errorindication on the <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-CLOSE">close</A>.  This usually indicates your filesystem ran outof disk space.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Warning: Use of `</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>` without parens is ambiguous</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(S) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that looks like abinary operator that could also have been interpreted as a term orunary operator.  For instance, if you know that the <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-RAND">rand</A> functionhas a default argument of 1.0, and you write<DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>rand + 5;</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>you may <I CLASS=emphasis>think</I> you wrote the same thing as<DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>rand() + 5;</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>but in actual fact, you got<DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>rand(+5);</PRE></DIV><P CLASS=para>So put in parentheses to say what you really mean.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Write on closed filehandle</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime before now.Check your logic flow.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>X outside of string</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) You had a <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-PACK">pack</A> template that specified a relative position beforethe beginning of the string being unpacked.  See <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-PACK">pack</A>.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>x outside of string</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) You had a <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-PACK">pack</A> template that specified a relative position afterthe end of the string being unpacked.  See <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-PACK">pack</A>.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Xsub `</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>` called in sort</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) The use of an external subroutine as a <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-SORT">sort</A>comparison is not yet supported.<DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>Xsub called in sort</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) The use of an external subroutine as a <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-SORT">sort</A>comparison is not yet supported.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>You can't use -l on a filehandle</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) A filehandle represents an opened file, and when you opened the file italready went past any symlink you are presumably trying to look for.Use a filename instead.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) And you probably never will, since you probably don't have thesources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a ripabout what you want.  Your best bet is to use the wrapsuid script inthe <I CLASS=emphasis>eg/</I> directory to put a setuid C wrapper around your script.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>You need to quote `</tt><I CLASS=emphasis>%s</I><tt CLASS=literal>`</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.  Unfortunately, youalready have a subroutine of that name declared, which means that Perl 5will try to call the subroutine when the assignment is executed, which isprobably not what you want.  (If it IS what you want, put an<tt CLASS=literal>&amp;</tt> in front.)<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>[gs]etsockopt() on closed fd</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) You tried to get or set a socket option on a closed socket.Did you forget to check the return value of your <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-SOCKET">socket</A> call?See <A HREF="ch03_02.htm#PERL2-CMD-GETSOCKOPT">getsockopt</A>.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>\1 better written as $1</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(W) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.  The useof backslashes is grandfathered on the righthand side of asubstitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable formbecause other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works betterif there are more than nine backreferences.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command-line redirection, andfound that <tt CLASS=literal>STDIN</tt> was a pipe, and that you also tried to redirect<tt CLASS=literal>STDIN</tt> using <tt CLASS=literal>&lt;</tt>.  Only one <tt CLASS=literal>STDIN</tt> stream to a customer,please.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command-line redirection, andthinks you tried to redirect <tt CLASS=literal>STDOUT</tt>both to a file and into a pipe to anothercommand.  You need to choose one or the other, though nothing's stopping youfrom piping into a program or Perl script which "splits" output into twostreams, such as<DIV CLASS=programlisting><P><PRE>open(OUT,"&gt;$ARGV[0]") or die "Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!";while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {    print STDOUT;    print OUT;}close OUT;</PRE></DIV></DL><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch08_07.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif"     ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="gloss_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif"     ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>History Made Practical</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Glossary</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></body></html>
