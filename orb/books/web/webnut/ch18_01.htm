While most Web browsers handle codes in the 100-, 200-, and 300- range silently, some error codes in the 400- and 500- range are commonly reported back to the user (e.g., "404 Not Found").<DIV CLASS=sect1><h2 CLASS=sect1><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="WEB-CH-18-SECT-0.1">Informational</A></h3><P CLASS=para>A response in the range of 100-199 is informational, indicating that the client's request was received and is being processed.<P><DL CLASS=variablelist><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>100 Continue</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The initial part of the request has been received and the client may continue with its request.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>101 Switching Protocols</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The server is complying with a client request to switch protocols to the one specified in the <tt CLASS=literal>Upgrade</tt> header field.</DL></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="WEB-CH-18-SECT-0.2">Client Request Successful</A></h3><P CLASS=para>A response in the range of 200-299 means that the client's requestwas successful.<P><DL CLASS=variablelist><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>200 OK</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The client's request was successful, and the server's response containsthe requested data.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>201 Created</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>This status code is used whenever a new URI is created. With thisresult code, the <tt CLASS=literal>Location</tt> header (described in<A HREF="ch19_01.htm">Chapter 19, <i>HTTP Headers</i></A>) is given by the server to specify where the new data was placed.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>202 Accepted</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The request was accepted but not immediately acted upon. More informationabout the transaction may be given in the entity body of the server'sresponse. There is no guarantee that the server will actually honorthe request, even though it may seem like a legitimate request at thetime of acceptance.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>203 Non-Authoritative Information</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The information in the entity header is from a local or third-partycopy and not from the original server. <p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>204 No Content</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>A status code and header is given in the response, but there is no entity body in the reply. Browsers should not update their document view upon receiving this response. This is a useful code for an imagemap handlerto return when the user clicks on useless or blank areas of an image.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>205 Reset Content</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The browser should clear the form used for this transactionfor additional input. Appropriate for data-entry CGI applications.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>206 Partial Content</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The server is returning partial data of the size requested.Used in response to a request specifying a <tt CLASS=literal>Range</tt> header.The server must specify the range included in the response withthe <tt CLASS=literal>Content-Range</tt> header.</DL></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="WEB-CH-18-SECT-0.3">Redirection</A></h3><P CLASS=para>A response code in the 300-399 range indicates that the request was notperformed and the client needs to take further action for a successfulrequest.<P><DL CLASS=variablelist><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>300 Multiple Choices</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The requested URI refers to more than one resource.For example, the URI could refer to a document that has been translated into many languages. The entity body returned by the servercould have a list of more specific data about how to choose the correctresource.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>301 Moved Permanently</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The requested URI is no longer used by the server, and the operationspecified in the request was not performed. The new location for therequested document is specified in the <tt CLASS=literal>Location</tt> header.All future requests for the document should use the new URI.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>302 Moved Temporarily</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The requested URI has moved, but only temporarily. The<tt CLASS=literal>Location</tt> header points to the new location. Immediately after receiving this status code, the client should use the new URI to resolve the request,but the old URI should be used for all future requests.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>303 See Other</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The requested URI can be found at a different URI (specified inthe <tt CLASS=literal>Location</tt> header) and shouldbe retrieved by a GET on that resource. <p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>304 Not Modified</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>This is the response code to an <tt CLASS=literal>If-Modified-Since</tt> header, where theURI has not been modified since the specified date.

Along with this code, the server provides the<tt CLASS=literal>Content-Language</tt>, <tt CLASS=literal>Content-Encoding</tt>, and <tt CLASS=literal>Content-Type</tt> headers.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>407 Proxy Authentication Required</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The proxy server needs to authorize the request before forwarding it. Used with the <I CLASS=emphasis>Proxy-Authenticate</I> header.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>408 Request Time-out</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>This response code means the client did not produce a full request within some predeterminedtime (usually specified in the server's configuration), and the serveris disconnecting the network connection.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>409 Conflict</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>This code indicates that the request conflicts with another requestor with the server's configuration. Information about the conflictshould be returned in the data portion of the reply.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>410 Gone</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>This code indicates that the requested URI no longer exists and hasbeen permanently removed from the server.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>411 Length Required</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The server will not accept the request without a <tt CLASS=literal>Content-Length</tt>header supplied in the request. <p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>412 Precondition Failed</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The condition specified by one or more <tt CLASS=literal>If...</tt> headersin the request evaluated to false. <p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>413 Request Entity Too Large</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The server will not process the request because its entitybody is too large. <p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>414 Request-URI Too Long</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The server will not process the request because its requestURI is too large.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>415 Unsupported Media Type</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>The server will not process the request because its entitybody is in an unsupported format.</DL></DIV><DIV CLASS=sect2><h3 CLASS=sect2><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="WEB-CH-18-SECT-0.5">Server Errors</A></h3><P CLASS=para>Response codes in the range of 500-599 indicate that the serverencountered an error and may be unable to performthe client's request.<P><DL CLASS=variablelist><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>500 Internal Server Error</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>This code indicates that a part of the server (for example, a CGI program)has crashed or encountered a configuration error.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>501 Not Implemented</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>This code indicates that the client requested an action thatcannot be performed by the server.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>502 Bad Gateway</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>This code indicates that the server (or proxy) encountered invalidresponses from another server (or proxy).<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><tt CLASS=literal>503 Service Unavailable</tt><DD><P CLASS=para>This code means that the service is temporarily unavailable, butshould be restored in the future.
