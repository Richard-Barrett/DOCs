In Netscape 3.0, JavaScriptcan communicate with the Java interpreter built into the browser andcan work with and control any Java applets in a Web page. <DIV CLASS=sect1><h2 CLASS=sect1><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="WEB-CH-21-SECT-1">21.1 JavaScript Overview</A></h2><P CLASS=para>  JavaScript is a simple, interpreted programming language. Client-side JavaScript is JavaScript embedded into HTML Web pages. Itallows "executable content" to be distributed over the Internet.(Currently the only JavaScript-enabled browsers are Netscape versions 2.0 and 3.0,and Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0.)  An example ofa client-side JavaScript application appears later in this chapter. <P CLASS=para>Server-side JavaScript provides an alternative to CGI scripts butgoes a step beyond:  the code is embedded directly within HTML pagesand allows executable server-side scripts to be intermixed with Web content. Server-side JavaScript dynamicallygenerates HTML that is displayed by the client. Butits most powerful features come from the server-side objects it has access to.The File object, for example, allows a server-side script to read andwrite files on the server. Keep in mind, however, that (as of this printing) Netscape's server-side JavaScript product, LiveWire, is still in beta testing, and no other vendors have yet developed products incorporating this technology. <P CLASS=para>Here's an overview of some of the things you can do with JavaScript:<P><UL CLASS=itemizedlist><li CLASS=listitem>Control the appearance and content of HTML documents.You can write arbitrary HTML code into a document as the documentis being parsed by the browser. You can also use the JavaScriptDocument object to generate documents entirely from scratch.<P><li CLASS=listitem>Control the behavior of the browser.For example, the Window object supports methods (a function/subroutinein JavaScript parlance) to pop up dialog boxes, to create and open/closeentirely new browser windows, etc.<P><li CLASS=listitem>Interact with document content.The JavaScript Document object, and the objects it contains, allowprograms to read, and sometimes interact with, portions of thedocument. It is not possible to read the actual text itself, but, forexample, it is possible to obtain a list of all hypertext links in adocument. By far the most important capability for interacting with documentcontents is provided by the Form object, and by the Form elementobjects it can contain: the Button, Checkbox, Hidden, Password,Radio, Reset, Select, Submit, Text, and Textarea objects. Theseobjects allow you to read and write the values of any input elementin any form in the document.<P><li CLASS=listitem>Interact with the user.An important feature of JavaScript is the ability to define "eventhandlers"--arbitrary pieces of code to be executed when aparticular event occurs (usually a user action). JavaScript can trigger any kind ofaction in response to user events. For example, code could bewritten to display a special message in the status line when the user positionsthe mouse over a hypertext link, or to pop up a confirmation dialogbox when the user submits an important form.<P><li CLASS=listitem>Read and write cookie values, and dynamically generate HTML based on the value of cookies. See <A HREF="ch12_01.htm">Chapter 12, <i>Cookies</i></A>, for more information on cookies.<P><li CLASS=listitem>Perform arbitrary (mathematical)computation. It also simplifies the process of computing and workingwith dates and times. (See the section entitled "Date Object" later in this chapter.)<P></UL><P CLASS=para>These are just a few of JavaScript's many capabilities. JavaScript can be used to greatly enhance your HTML code.</DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch20_01.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch21_02.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Media Types and Subtypes</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Client-Side JavaScript Examples</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
