Setting up differently named and addressed sites onthe same computer and server is a complex issue and is not discussed indetail in this book. However, the Windows platforms are quite capable of supporting multiple IP addresses on the same machine. Windows NT supportsmultiple IP addresses using a single or multiple adapters. Windows 95 supportsmultiple IP addresses only with multiple adapters--one IP address peradapter. The WebSite server can support an unlimited number of IP addresses,or as many as the operating system can.<DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><p><img align=middle src="./figs/wm_2403.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 26-3]" width=324 height=339></DIV><P CLASS=para>WebSite handles multiple virtual servers in a rather elegant way byusing unique "nicknames" for each address. When WebSite receives a requestfor a specific IP address, it prefixes the URL with that address's nickname.Document and CGI mapping are critically important under this scheme, andURLs for each virtual server must be mapped using the nickname.The use of the nickname is of no concern to your users. They simplyrequest URLs using whatever IP address or hostname they require.<P CLASS=para>WebSite gives you an easy way and a hard way to set up virtual servers.Both paths begin on the Identity page of Server Admin. When you clickthe Multiple Identities box, an alert box pops up to tell you thatIP addresses have been added to the server's configuration. PressOK and the page changes to show all the IP addresses on the systemin the pulldown list box. The first address shown is always 127.0.0.1,<I CLASS=emphasis>localhost</I>. You must configure this address just like any othervirtual server that you set up. To set up a new IP address, selectit from the list and press the Wizard button. The Identity Wizardwill then appear and ask you to supply information about the newaddress. The Identity Wizard automates the setup of nicknames anddocuments and CGI mapping for you. It will also create new directoriesif you wish to use them for the new web. Using the Wizard is theeasy way.<P CLASS=para>The hard way is the path you take if you do notpress the Wizard button after selecting the new address to be configured.You must then provide the fully qualified domain name for the newaddress, the URL prefix you wish to use (it must begin with a slash /),and the name of an access log file, if you don't wish to use the main access file. You must supply <I CLASS=emphasis>.log</I> with the access logfilename; WebSite will not add it automatically.<P CLASS=para>Once you have filled in all of the fields, press the Update button.Follow the same steps to configure any other new addresses youmay have. When all new addresses are set up, press Apply.<P CLASS=para>Filling in the Identity page is only part of manually setting upa new IP address. You now have to go to the Mapping page andcreate mappings for the new address by using its nickname.Make sure you use the address' nickname in front of every URLpath you map. For example, a new virtual server has been set upon the Identity page with the server name <I CLASS=emphasis>webs.provider.com</I> andthe nickname <I CLASS=emphasis>/webs</I>. shows the Document URL mappingsfrom the Mapping page with the document root directory set for<I CLASS=emphasis>/webs</I>. <DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><p><img align=middle src="./figs/wm_2404.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 26-4]" width=331 height=96></DIV><P CLASS=para>All mapped URLs for that server must begin with<I CLASS=emphasis>/webs/</I>. CGI mappings also must be mapped using the nicknames.Keep in mind that URLs mapped by nicknames for different virtual serverscan use the same physical directory. This will probably be the casefor some of your CGI programs.</DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch26_03.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top><A HREF="ch26_05.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtnexta.gif" ALT="Next" border=0></A></td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Mapping</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>Directory Listings</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
