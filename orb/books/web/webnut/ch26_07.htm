You can restrict accessby user with a user/password system, by the requesting IP address or hostname(class restrictions), or both. Three pages of Server Admin areused for access control.<P CLASS=para>The Users and Groups pages are where you create users and give thempasswords and create groups of users. WebSite also uses theconcept of "realms," which are large collections of groupsand users. When you want to control access to a URL pathon your web, you pick a realm first, and then groups andusers in that realm who are permitted access.<P CLASS=para>The Users page of Server Admin (shown in is for managing users and their passwords; it has three sections:<P><DL CLASS=variablelist><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Authentication Realm</I><DD><P CLASS=para>You can select an existing realm to use (such as Web Server), createa new realm (by pressing the New button), or delete an existingrealm. Your web can have one or multiple realms. You may wantto have a separate realm for each virtual server you have. Whenyou create a realm, it has no users.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>User</I><DD><P CLASS=para>You can select an existing user in the realm, change a user's password(by pressing the Password button), or delete a user. The defaultWeb Server realm has an Admin user.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Group Membership</I><DD><P CLASS=para>You can view and change the group membership status for theselected user. Every realm automatically has an Administratorsgroup and a Users group. All groups you have created within a realm on theGroups page are available here for selection. Every user in a realm is a member of Users, and cannot be removed unless they are deletedaltogether.<DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><p><img align=middle src="./figs/wm_2407.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 26-7]" width=324 height=339></DIV><P CLASS=para></DL><P CLASS=para>The Groups page of Server Admin (shown in is used for managing groups and groups membership. It has three sections:<P><DL CLASS=variablelist><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Authentication Realm</I><DD><P CLASS=para>This area works exactly the same as it does on the Users page. Hereyou select which realm will be affected by the changes you makeon the rest of the page. Note that on both the Users and Groupspages, you can create or delete realms.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Group</I><DD><P CLASS=para>You can select an existing group in a realm, add a new group, ordelete a group. Every realm automatically has an Administratorsand a Users group. All users in a realm are members of Usersand cannot be removed.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Group Membership</I><DD><P CLASS=para>You can view and change the selected group's membership list.All available users in the selected realm will appear in thenon-members box (if they aren't already members). To add a user tothe group, select her name and press the Add button. It is easierto add users to groups on the Users page when you create them andset their passwords. If the Group(s) you want to add them to are alreadycreated, you can add them there and save a possible extra step.<DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><p><img align=middle src="./figs/wm_2408.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 26-8]" width=324 height=339></DIV><P CLASS=para></DL><P CLASS=para>Once you have your users, groups, and realms set up, youcan assign access based on them on the Access Control page.Access can also be assigned based on IP address or hostname of therequesting browser. You also use this page to disable automaticdirectory listings and determine how the server will controlaccess restrictions per URL.<P CLASS=para>The Access Control page is shown in It has severalsections:<P><DL CLASS=variablelist><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>URL Path or Special Function</I><DD><P CLASS=para>You can select, add, or delete a URL path or special function.The URL path cannot specify a file, so all files and subdirectoriesunder that directory have the restrictions applied to them.You can protect any document or CGI directory. To add a new URLpath, press the New button. In the popup dialog, type in thenew URL path and select a realm to which it will be restricted.Since restrictions are applied by path, many "control points"may exist along a path. The deepest access control point determinesthe access restrictions at a particular level. In other words, whenthe server receives a request from a browser, it starts at the level of the request and works up levels until it finds a control point.The server applies the restrictions at that point and stops; itdoes not look at restrictions above that point.The special functions are URLs that start with a tilde (~) characterand are handled in a special way by the server. Some special functionURLs only retrieve data, such a <I CLASS=emphasis>~stats</I> or <I CLASS=emphasis>~imagemap</I>.Other special function URLs cause the server to perform an administrativetask, such as <I CLASS=emphasis>~cycle-acc</I> or <I CLASS=emphasis>~cycle-err</I> to cycle theaccess and error logs. All of the special function URLs in WebSiteare on the Access Control list, although only those that cause the serverto do something are protected. You cannot delete special functions fromthe access control list.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Disable Directory Listings</I><DD><P CLASS=para>This checkbox disables automatic directory listings for the selectedURL. Users will be able to view or download documents in that URLdirectory hierarchy only with the specific filename. You can alsoadd user authentication and class restrictions to a URL with disableddirectory listings (i.e., authorized users can receive a directorylisting).<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Logical OR Users and Class</I><DD><P CLASS=para>This checkbox tells the server how to evaluate access control. When thebox is not checked, the server uses the default method, firstlooking for class restrictions and then for user authentication(if the class restrictions are met). If the box is checked,the server evaluates both class restrictions and user authentication.If either condition is met, the server returns the requested URL.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Authorized Users &amp; Groups</I><DD><P CLASS=para>You can view or change the users and/or groups authorized forthe selected URL path or special function. The realm for thisURL is displayed above the list. If no users or groups are shownin this box, then the URL has no user authenticationrestrictions.<p><DT CLASS=varlistentry><I CLASS=emphasis>Class Restrictions</I><DD><P CLASS=para>In this section of the Access Control page, you specifywhich connections to the Web are allowed and which are denied.First decide the logic the server should follow in testingconnections. Should it first deny and then allow, or first allowand then deny? Which you should choose depends on the scope of restriction. To delete an entry, select the entry fromthe appropriate box and press Delete. To add a new entry,place the cursor in the appropriate box and press New. A popupdialog will open where you type in the address.Class restrictions accept three kinds of entries: <tt CLASS=literal>all</tt>, afull or partial IP address, or a full or partial domain name.You can use metacharacters (<tt CLASS=literal>*</tt> and <tt CLASS=literal>?</tt>) to match all or part of eitherIP addresses or domain names. If you use domain names, you must turn on DNS reverse lookup on the Logging page. The server thenlooks up the name for the IP address of each requesting node.It is recommended that you don't use domain names or DNS reverselookup because the extra DNS traffic and waiting time may adverselyaffect server performance.</DL><DIV CLASS=figure><h4 CLASS=figure><A CLASS="TITLE" NAME="ch26-FIGURE-AUTOID.1">Figure 26-9: Access Control page</A></h4><p><img align=middle src="./figs/wm_2409.gif" alt="[Graphic: Figure 26-9]" width=324 height=339></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS=htmlnav><P><HR align=left width=515><table width=515 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top><A HREF="ch26_06.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txtpreva.gif" ALT="Previous" border=0></A></td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index.htm"><IMG SRC="gifs/txthome.gif" ALT="Home" border=0></a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=172 align=left valign=top>Logging</td><td width=171 align=center valign=top><a href="index/idx_0.htm">Book Index</a></td><td width=172 align=right valign=top>&nbsp;</td></tr></table><!-- JavaScript: prev.js -->&nbsp;<!-- JavaScript: next.js --></DIV></BODY></HTML>
